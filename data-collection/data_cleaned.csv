1891,,,,,,,,9/9/1891,Commission:Military,"Appointment of Lieutenant Richard Cunningham Windeyer to Lieutenant of the No. 7 Company of the 36th ""Peel"" Regiment commencing on August 28, 1891.Richard C. Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer. When the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year. The recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.When asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. ""I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare"" said the Colonel. ""My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time."" Windeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going. He was later given command of Niagara Camp for a short period of time.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/2018016003.jpg,,2018.016.003,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/2018016003.jpg,,"36th Regiment 36 Regiment 74th Battalion 74 Battalion Niagara Camp First World War World War One Infantry, Canadian Expeditionary Force CEFMilitia",

1759,,,,,,,,"Sept 8-11,1759",Newspaper,"Vol.V1 #422 of The London Chronicle or Universal Evening Post dated from Sept. 8, 1759 to September 11, 1759. The articles within the newspaper focus on the progress that is being made by the British army during the French-Indian War.Transcriptions of relevant articles are as follows:Copty of a Letter from James De Lancey, Fsq; Lieutenant Governor of New York, to Mr. Secretary Pitt.New York, August 5, 1759Sir,As I would not slip an opportunity of conveying agreeable news, I take this, by a merchant ship, ready to sail for Bristol, with pleasure to congratulate you on the success of his Majesty's arms, in defeating the French army, coming to the relief of Niagara, which brought on the early surrender of the fort, whereby the most important pass in all of the Indian countires is brought under his Majesty's subjection.The army defeated was made up by troops drawn from Venango, Beave River, and Presq' Isle, so that those parts must in a manner lie open to Brigadier General Stanwix; and therefore I cannot doubt of his success.I received the account yesterday afternoon by express: for the particulars I refer to the inclosed relation sent me by Lieut. Coventry, Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General at Albany, which contains the substance of the intelligence I have received. Copy of Lieut. Coventry's Letter to Lieutenant Governor De Lancey.Albany, August 2, 1759SirI have this moment received the agreeable news of Niagara's surrendering to our army on the 25th ult. Six hundred and seven prisoners are on their way from Niagara for this place. Lieut. Moncrieff brought the dispatches, and sets out tomorrow morning for Ticonderoga. If Col. Amherst be not failed, let him have the enclosed.Copy of the Account of the Defeat of the French near Niagara, and Reduction of the Fort, inclosed in Lieut. Coventry's Letter.This day Lieut. Moncrieff, Aide de Camp to the late Gen. Prideaux, arrived here from Niagara, which he left the 26th inst. in his way to Gen. Amherst. From the said gentleman we have the following particulars; viz. That, after the melancholy accident of the 20th [Brigadier General Prideaux being killed by the bursting of a cohorn] the command of the army devolving on Sir William Johnson, he continued to pursue the late general's vigorous measures, and erected his third battery within 100 yards of the flag bastion. Having intelligence from his Indians of a large party on their march from the falls, to relieve the fort, Sir William made a disposition to prevent them. The 23rd, in the evening, he ordered the light infantry, and picquets of the line, to lie near the road on our left, leading from the falls to the for. These he reinforced, in the morning of hte 24th, with the grenadiers, and part of the 46th regiment, all under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Massey. Lieutenant Colonel Farquhar, with the 44th battalion, was ordered to the tail of the trenches, to support the guard of the trenches commanded by Major Beckwith. About eight in the morning, our Indians advanced to speak to the French Indians, which the enemy declined. The action began soon after, with the scream, as usual, from the enemy; but our troops were so well diposed to receive them in front, and our Indians on their flanks, that, in less than an hour's time, the whole army was ruined. The number of slain was not ascertained, as the pursuit continued for five miles. 17 officers were made prisoners, among whom are M. D'Aubry, Chief in Command, wounded; M. De Lignery, second in command, and wounded,; also M. Marin, Leader of the Indians; M. de Villie, Repentini, Martini, Basone, all Captains; and several others. After this defeat, which was in sight of the garrison, Sir William sent Major Harvey into the fort, with a list of the officers taken, recommending it to the Commanding Officer to surrenderm before more blood was shed, and while he had it in his power to restrain the Indians. The Commanding Officer, to be certain of such a defeat, sent an Officer of his to see the prisoners; they were shown to him; and, in short, the capitulation was finished about ten at night on the 24th, by which teh garrison surrendered with the honours of war; which Lieut.

We expect them here tomorrow on their way to New York. Whitewall, September 3. This morning Lieutenant Colonel Amherst arrived here with letters from Major Ganeral Amherst to the Right Honourable Mr. Secretary Pitt, dated at the camp of Ticonderoga the 17th July; giving an account of his having taken possession of the lines of that place on the 24th, the garrison having abandoned and set fire to the fort. The preceding night, at ten o'clock, some volunteers got into the fort, and brought the colours away with them. The troops extinguished the fire as soon as possible, and saved all they could. The letters add, that Honourable Colonel Townshend, Deputy Adjutant General, was killed on the 25th of July, but on what occasion is not mentioned. Whitewall, September 10On Sunday the 8th instant, at two of the clock in the afternoon, Captain Prescott arrived with the following letter from Major General Amherst to Mr. Secretary Pitt, dated Crown-Point, August 5, 1759.Sir,I did myself the honour of writing to you a very short letter on the 27th of July, as I would not retard Lieut. Col. Amherst from settin gout, that he might acquiaint you of his Majesty's troops being in possession of the Fort and lines of Ticonderoga; and I now send Captain Prescott with this, to inform you of the great event of the redution of Niagara; and at the same time to give you an account of my arrival here with a part of the army under my immediate command.The 27th of July, I encamped within the lines, and began to level the trenches and batteries, filled up the road I had made from Lake Chaplain to the Saw-Mill River for the carrying on the siege, encamped four battalions of Provincials near the Fort for repairing the works, sent 500 men to Fort George for provisions, etc. ordered all the French boats to be fished up, and the brig and boats I had ordered to be built for carrying gunsm, to be finished in all haste, that I may be superior to the enemy's troops on the Lake. 28th. The fire was not totally extinguished. I fowarded everything as fast as possible that I might get possession of Crown Point without loss of time. In the aftrnoong I received an account of most unlucky accident, the death of Brigadier-General Prideaux, who was walking in the trenches on the evening of the 19th; the gunner carelessly fireed a cohorn and shot him, when the approaches were within 140 yards of the covered way. I immediately ordered Brigadier-General Gage to set out for Oswego, to take on him the command of that army. 29th. Five companies of Provincials arrived this day from the provinces. Intelligence that the enemy troops, which were encamped on the eastern side of the Lake, were now moved to Crown Point: I kept small parties constantly looking from the mountains into Crown Point, their two sloops, and a schooner there: They depend on my not getting boats over, and that I shall be obliged to build some of force. 30th. It raiend hard last night, and this day, which put a great stop to getting the batteaus over the Carrying-Place.31st. I ordered the Fort by the water side to be put in good order, and to be completed, as the enemy had not quite finished it: Ordered the Fort of Ticonderoga to be repaired upon the same plan as the enemy had built it, which will save great time and expenses, as it si but a small part of the whole that is ruined; the costs the enemy has been at in building the Fort and houses are very great. The glacis and covered way quite good: The counterscarp of the glacis, masonry: The counterscarp of the dutch, masonry. Two ravelins of masonry that cover the only front to which approaches can be carried on. The Fort, a square with four bastions, built with logs on the rocks, which are covered with some masonry to level the foundation. The wood part of it is the worst finished. One bastion, and a part of two courtins, demolished, but not in the front that can be earliest attacked. The casements are good; the walls of the burnt barracks are not damaged. Eleven good ovens have helped us greatly. As the situation of the Fort is very advantageous for the protection of his Majesty's dominions, and the approaches may be rendered as difficul to the enemy, as they have been to the King's troops, and that there is no fault in it but its being small, I have thought proper to have it repaired,which I hope will meet with your approbation. 1st of August. At noon a scouting party's came in, said the enemy had abandoned Crown Point; this makes no alteration in my motions, as I am already trying all I can to get forward; but on this, I sent away Major General Graham with all expedition to command the 2nd battalion of the Royal Highland regiment, and to march them to Ofwego, that in case, from the unfortunate death of Brigadier General Prideaux, the reduction should not have taken place. Brigadier General Gage may return to the attack with the utmost vigour and dispatch, and to pursue the ulterior operations of the campaign.2nd. Very rainy weather put a stop entirely to getting boats over the Carrying Place this day.3rd. A party I had sent to Crown Point, brought in a deserter from late Forbes' in a French coat, one that I had pardoned for desertion when I was at Fort George. I thought it so necessary to make an immediate example, that I had him hanged directly. Sent two hundred rangers through the woods to Crown Point.4th. The Generale at two in the morning, Assemblee half an hour later, and the Rangers, Light Infantry, Grenandiers, and two brigades of Regulars, were soon embarked, except the Royal Highland regiment that waited for boats, which detained me some time. I however arrived at Crown Point before the evening, landed and posted all the corps, some encamped and some lay on their arms. At night, Lieut. Moncrieff, whom I had sent with Brigadier General Prideaux, arrived with a letter from Sir William Johnson, enclsoing the capitulation of Niagara, both which I have the satisfaction to sent to you.5th. I ordered Lieut. Col. Eyre to trace out the ground for a Fort, which I will set about with all possible expedition. This post secure entirely all his Majesty's dominions that are behind it, from the inroads of the enemy, and the scalping parties that have infested the whole country, and it will give great peace and quiet to the King's subjects, who will now settle in their habitations from this to New York. I shall take fast hold of it, and not neglect, at the same time, to forward every measure I can to enable me to pass Lake Chaplain, and you may be assured, Sir, I shall, to the best of my capacity, try to pursue everything for the success and honour of his Majesty's arms.I am, etc.Jeff.

Was it painted prior to 1833 as the inscription states or later, after he settled in Hamilton, as is more likely?

1901,,,,,,,,10/1/1901,Print:Photographic,"Photograph of the Prince and Princess of Wales (Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York) taken at the Queen's Royal Hotel, October 1901. They are in the foreground.The future King George V was born June 3, 1865 and died January 20, 1936. He was King from 1910 to 1936. Upon the death of his eldest brother in 1892 he was named the Duke of York. Upon the death of Queen Victoria he became the Prince of Wales in 1901 when his father ascended the throne as King Edward VII. The royal tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, 16 March 1901 - 1 November 1901, was undertaken for several reasons: to assert the pivotal role of the monarch as the unifying force of the empire, to thank those countries which had contributed forces to the war in South Africa, which was still being fought, and to open the first parliament of the new Commonwealth of Australia. The tour had been postponed by the death of Queen Victoria in January, 1901 but was actively promoted by the Secretary for the Colonies, Mr Joseph Chamberlain, and the First Lord of the Treasury, Mr Arthur Balfour, despite the misgivings of the new king, Edward VII. The Duke and Duchess visited Australia, South Africa, and Canada, landing at Quebec on 16th September and remained in Canada for a month. Accompanied by the Governor-General, the 4th Earl of Minto, and the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfred Laurier, for part of their journey, the royal couple visited Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, Niagara, St John, Halifax, and St John's. Accompanying them as well were twelve officials of the Royal Household for the Duke and seven officials for the Duchess. Among them were Prince Alexander of Teck, the Duchess's brother, as an aide-de-camp, who later became the Earl of Athlone and Governor-General of Canada 1939-1945. One of the Duke's equerries was the Hon. Derek Keppel whose mother was the daughter of Sir Alan MacNab of Hamilton, Ontario. She had married her husband, later the 7th Earl of Albemarle, at Dundurn Castle in Hamilton. (Mr Derek Keppel's sister-in-law, the Hon. Mrs George Keppel, was Edward VII's mistress, and the great-grandmother of the present Duchess of Cornwall - Camilia Parker-Bowles.) The tour was a huge success for the monarchy and empire and for the maturing of the Duke of Cornwall into his royal role. On November 9, 1901, his father, King Edward VII, created him Prince of Wales. As George V (1910-1936) he succeeded his father as King nine years later. The stop in Canada included a stay at the Queen's Royal Hotel in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara. The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished. In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity. A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, where at the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/98614(a)-4.jpg,,986.14(A),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/98614(a)-4.jpg,,"Queen's Royal Hotel, Royal Niagara Hotel",

However, her program came under criticism as she did not continue to follow the girls after they left the home and some were found to have been placed in adverse situations.

1820,,,,,,,,10/7/1820,Letter,"William Dickson was a prominent lawyer, merchant, and land developer, who was based in Niagara. He was also the respected and trusted lawyer for the Six Nations. For the services he rendered, the Six Nations had surrendered to him in March 1809, a block of approximately 4,000 acres at the mouth of the Grand River in Sherbrooke Township. This block was adjacent to Block 5, some 30,500 acres, that was originally purchased by William Jarvis, Jarvis was short of funds and so he gave up his claim. Block 5 was eventually purchased by Thomas Douglas, the Rt. Honourable, The Earl of Selkirk (1771-1820). He was a 'colonization philanthropist' who purchased several properties for proposed settlement by displaced Scot Highlanders and poor Irish peasants. Selkirk paid �3,850 for this Block, but he took out a mortgage for �3,485 held by the Six Nations. To enlarge the size of his grant he also purchased Dickson's adjacent grant of 4,000 acres. Selkirk never made any of the mortgage payments and the colony lapsed undeveloped. When Selkirk died in 1820, he was bankrupt, and the full mortgage was still outstanding. Dickson, who had never been anxious to sell to Selkirk in the first place, purchased the tract back from the Selkirk estate. This is what makes up the prime subject matter of this letter. The letter is also significant for the background information given: 'The Emperor' referred to is William Lyon Mackenzie who had recently arrived in Upper Canada and was already creating 'mischief'.

1812,,,,,,,,10/26/1812,Pass,"Lincoln Militia Leave pass for Ebenezer Culver during the War of 1812.During the summer and into the autumn of 1812, the small British garrisons at Fort George, Amherstburg, Fort York and other posts relied on Militiamen to augment their forces to defend against expected American attacks. Militia volunteers in the ""flank companies"" of regiments were expected to serve longer periods of active duty and were trained to fight alongside the well-trained British regulars. The regular or ""sedentary"" militia, comprised of all able men between the ages of 16 and 60, were given rudimentary training and were expected to be available for shorter periods of time, ""called up"" to work on road repairs, sentry duty, rowing bateaux, transporting supplies, and so on. They were also expected to fight if required but mostly within their own home areas. Militiamen had been involved in the capture of Michilimackinac in July and the capture of Detroit in August, 1812, and were a key factor in the British victory at the Battle of Queenston Heights on October 13, fighting alongside the British regulars and First Nations allies.One of the problems with the militiamen was that many of the men were also farmers, constantly worried about their farms when they were away on active service, particularly during the planting and the harvest times. At Fort George, many of the militiamen absented themselves without leave to travel home to do the haying or the harvest. Officially, they were considered deserters, a very serious crime in the British Army. However, almost all of the men returned to duty after finishing whatever they needed to do on their farms. Few thought this a serious transgression. The British did not take it so lightly, court-martialling and heavily fining those who had gone AWOL once they returned.For the British, they needed a body of militiamen on which they could rely to be where they were expected to be at any given time. The rules on desertion were strictly enforced to ensure that however many militiamen were expected to be on duty were indeed present and accounted for. They also realized that these men had to return to their farms from time to time to ensure that their families had sufficient food and that agriculture did not generally suffer as a result of their military service. After all, the British garrisons relied on locally grown food along with the salt beef, salt pork, dried peas and barrels of flour shipped from England. To control the situation, the British required militiamen on active duty to apply for leaves of absence, which would be granted when the situation permitted. To enforce the system, patrols of Regulars and Militia watched the roads and questioned men of military age, apprehending those suspected of being AWOL from active duty. This would have been rather trying, as few militiamen were provided with uniforms in 1812 and would have been indistinguishable from farmers and tradesmen not on active military duty, simply going about their business. In some cases, First Nations allies were paid a bounty for bringing in deserters from the Regular Army and militiamen who had taken their leave without permission.It was very much in a man's favour to apply for legitimate leave, something readily granted providing that there was no obvious threats looming in that theatre of war. Those with permission were given a passport to carry, a slip of paper signed by their regimental colonel, granting them leave but ensuring that they were prepared to be immediately called back from leave in the situation required. When the recipient of this pass was questioned while on his way home, the passport provided proof that he was legally away from his post and not a deserter.This artifact is a rare example of such a passport, signed by Lieutenant-Colonel William Claus, Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Lincoln Militia. The date of the paper was two weeks after the Battle of Queenston Heights. No further trouble was expected that year and the British felt safe releasing a number of militiamen from active duty on the understanding that they would be called back if required.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/064/2012028001.jpg,,2012.028.001,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/064/thumbs/2012028001.jpg,,War of 1812Lincoln Militia,

1812,,,,,,,,10/22/1812,Receipt,"Receipt signed by James Gordon, Assistant Commissary, for stands of arms (muskets, bayonets with scabbards and cartridge boxes) returned to the stores at Fort George by the 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia, October 22, 1812. GlossaryStands of Arms: A stand of arms was a musket, bayonet, bayonet scabbard, and cartridge box in which a soldier carried his ammunition.Stores: The first floor of Blockhouse 2 at Fort George was outfitted as a Commissariat and Ordnance Store in which, among other things, stands of arms for issue to the militia were stored.Commissary: The Commissary of the Field Train Department, part of the Army Staff, was responsible for maintaining, ordering, storing and issuing military weapons and associated equipment. In the first year of the War of 1812 Upper Canada was unprepared to fight a war. While the small number of British regular soldiers in the province was uniformed, armed and equipped, there was a shortage of extra uniforms, muskets and equipment for issue to the militia. When militiamen were called out for active duty, they were expected to wear their civilian clothing. At depots like Fort George, those militiamen who reported for active duty were issued muskets, bayonets and cartridge boxes containing sixty cartridges. At the end of their period of active duty, the militiamen were required to return these items to stores where they would be cleaned, repaired if required, and stored ready for reissue to the next group of militiamen called out for active service.In this case, the stands of arms had been issued to a number of men of the 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia who had fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights. When they were allowed to return to their homes, they had to return their equipment to stores at Fort George.This document is of special interest because it refers to the muskets issued as being ""French"" muskets. The muskets when returned must have required some attention as the muskets are listed as ""repairable."" The bayonets were still considered ""serviceable."" The ""French"" muskets may have been French Charleville muskets, acquired in significant quantities by the Americans during and after the Revolution or possibly American made Springfield muskets, based largely on the French Charlevilles. Both fired a .69 calibre musket ball and were collectively referred to as ""French"" to distinguish them, and their ammunition, from the British issued .75 calibre musket. These French muskets at Fort George were taken from Fort Detroit following its surrender on August 16, 1812. Significant numbers of these captured weapons were also given as gifts to Native allies. It should be noted that more than 1000 additional ""French"" muskets were acquired following the defeat of the Americans at Queenston Heights.James Gordon was appointed to the British Field Train Department as an Assistant Commissary on February 5, 1808. The Field Train Department came under the responsibility of the Master-General of Ordnance, a department that reported directly to ""Horse Guards,"" the Military Headquarters of the British Army in London, England. The Field Train Department was redubbed the Military Stores Department, a more descriptive title, after the War of 1812. James Gordon, responsible for the inventory of military stores at Fort George in 1812, went on half-pay on August 17, 1817, when the British severely reduced the size of the army following the Napoleonic Wars.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/2006036001.jpg,,2006.036.001,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/2006036001.jpg,,"Fort George, War of 1812War of 1812-14Lincoln Militia, Lincoln and Welland Militia, Lincoln & Welland Militia",
1863,,,,,,,,10/1/1863,Obituary,"Obituary of Gertrude S. Hakes. Cover is black with gold trim, text and image of mourners at a graveyard. Gertrude S. Hakes died at Port Robinson Ontario August 27, 1863. She was the adopted daughter of J.S. and Maria S. Hakes.Transcription is as follows:Died. At Port Robinson, Canada West, August 27, 1863, Mrs. Gertrude S. Blake, aged 24 years, adopted daughter of J.S. and Maria S. Hakes, of this city.This notice appeared in our papers without a word of sorrow or regret for the early and sudden exit it announced.My relations to the deceased were so intimate that I could claim the privilege of being silent in my grief. She was so dear to me that it is difficult for me to trust myself to speak of her. Yet I cannot allow one to pass away who was so much the pride and joy of our school for many years without some record of her great worth, and our great loss.A thousand loving and admiring hearts must crave a tribute to her memory.But what shall we say of her whose short life was spent in preparing to live? Mrs. Blake had just entered upon the career of usefulness which is woman's destiny when summoned to another sphere. She had lived long enough, however, as a wife and mother to show that she could meet, with case and skill, the claims of every social and domestic relation; that she could reproduce, in a home of her own, the beauty, comfort and hallowed influences of the home of her childhood; that she brought to the fulfillment of these duties a devout spirit, sound judgement, great energy, presistency, and enthusaism, added to affections which prompted her to consecrate all her powers to the good of others, and that high intellectual tastes and attainments, all compatable with excellence in the domestic arts, to show rich endowments well trained and used in the family, the church and the school. As a pupil of the Seminary her memory will be most lovingly and respectfully cherished, - by her classmates as one with whom it was difficult to compete - who stimulated them to their highest efforts - who took every honor of the Insitution, and was first in every brilliant achievement of scholarship.Force of character, and the submissiveness of christian spirit were envinced and cultivated by her constant struggle with physical weakness.Regulating the languor to which she was subject, and her frequent illness, as appointed by Divine Wisdom, for her moral discipline, she waited patiently for strength; pursued, with zest, a second term, or year, studies which her health would not permit her to learn throughly the first; devoted as many years as were thus made neccessary to complete the full course of study, and exercised so much good sense in the care of her health that she grew in strength as she grew in knoweldge - the willing spirit triumphant over the weak body.While our hearts are bowed with our own grief, and a sense of the loss to society of a woman so eminently fitted in teh discharge of all the affairs of love and friendship to bless it, we are sensible that the burden of this great sorrow rests upon the husband, her infant children, and her adopted parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hakes.To the latter she had evern been a beloved daughter. She came to them a bright and joyous child. They enjoyed the unfolding of her characterin the atmosphere of domestic and christian love with which they surrounded her. They afforded her facilities for the liberal culture which her powers demanded. Hopes and aspirations for her which had been excited by her high aims and resolves had been more than satisfied by the wealth of her attainments and resources. The strength, elevation and harmony of her character, she had become the delightful companion and most valued friend. When they gave her up to new relations they were happy in witnessing the broader culture which sprung from her new duties and affections.Called upon for the final seperation their consolation is that her noblest development will come from Divine Wisdom, teaching her to solve the dark mysteries of earth in the light of heaven. Their's are not buried joys and hopes, but such as lead their sould to antipate the enjoyment of her gifts and graces in that celestial home where there shall be joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighling shall flee away.She had prepared for the presence of our Lord, and when summoned to it her faith failed not. Her Saviour, whom she had glorified on earth by dedicating herself to him in early youth, and doing the work of life as in his service, supported her in her dying hour by the blessed hope that he would glorify her in heaven. It is mysterious to us that one so amply furnished with armor for the most comprehensive life-work should be smitten just as the battle of life had commenced. Yet her life is not lost. It was not a failure. She will be cherished as the type of a christian woman. Her numerous associates, to whose sorrowful regrets I give voice, will not allow her example to die. As they weep for her they will emulate her virtues.Sarah L.

1839,,,,,,,,10/16/1839,Affidavit,"This is an interesting document, and its validity cannot be determined at this time. The document appears to have been written by Andrew Cohoe on October 16, 1839, but Andrew had died in 1790, and had no relatives named for him. This document reads: ""This may certify that I Andrew Cahoe [Cohoe] moved with Edward Topping [Toppham] on lot No 1 in the 8th concession of the Township of Pelham and lived there ten years during which time I helped clear and fence from the North West corner at the old stake thence South on the line nearby falf the length of said lot or as far as it is cleared now at this time. And the line was easily traced at that time both north and south. And the fence was built to or nearly to the line. And the corner stake was there yet when I left the said place which was in the year one thousand eight hundred and four.N.B. The graves were all west of said line. Andrew Cahoe 16th of 10 month 1839."" Andrew came to Niagara in 1787 with his wife, Deborah and seven children, and received a land grant in the Township of Pelham. He petitioned the government for this land prior to his death, but it had not been issued until after. The fact that this document states that he lived on this property for 10 years is curious since he died approximately 3 years after arriving in Niagara. Following Andrews death, his wife petitioned the government in 1799 to have the deed of the property in her name or have it divided between her children. The province approved this. Her eldest son, Asta, was barred from obtaining any of this property has he had enlisted in the Rangers and then soon after deserted and fled the province. Following the death of her husband, Deborah eventually married Edward Topham. Perhaps this document was forged in an effort for Asta and his descendants to gain access to this land.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/082/98231883.jpg,,982.318.83,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/082/thumbs/98231883.jpg,,"property clearingproperty lines, Gander propertylot 1, concession 8Township of Pelhamgraves",

In August 1853, the local newspaper ""The Niagara Mail"" reported that the ship rescued Ben Hockley, a slave from Tennessee, after he was swept into Lake Ontario by the river's current. He was found on a gate which he used as a raft to cross the river from Lewiston to Niagara. With the financial crisis of the 1850's, it was last used as a steamer in 1856 and was later converted to a scow. It was renamed the Globe.F. H. Granger was born in Toronto. He worked with the Royal Lyceum Theatre as a scenic artist before moving to Niagara to work in the Dock's area to paint for the company which produced railway cars. He opened an office on Queen Street as a painter of signs and houses. There remains a collection in the museum of watercolours he painted around Niagara-on-the-Lake in the 1850's and 1860's.Sir John Beverley Robinson, for whom the boat was named, was a veteran of the Battle of Queenston Heights, and served as Chief Justice from 1829 to 1862.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/988203-2.jpg,,988.203,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/thumbs/988203-2.jpg,,"Chief Justice Robinson, Niagara Harbour and Dock Company, The Globe",

He was a major railway builder and built a railway from Balaclava to Sebastopol to carry supplies during the Crimean War. It is possible that 'C. Camidge' was working for Peto's firm in Niagara during the construction of the early railways. It is believed that this is Charles Camidge who worked for the Peto firm as paymaster and came to Canada to assist with railroad development. He settled in Niagara, taught at a local school (see Janet Carnochan's History of Niagara). Camidge was accused of harming a young girl from Maria Rye's school for British girls called ""Our Western Home"" and went to trial in St. Catharines.

Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer. When the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year. The recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.When asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. ""I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare"" said the Colonel. ""My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.""

Shaw was researching the property of the Niagara Harbour and Dock Company in search of references to Collingwood Street as a right of way.Collingwood Street was not found to be on any of the registered plans or property agreements.""Dear sirs,The Niagara Pumping stationWe have your letter of the 21st instant and made a thorough search in the Registry office this morning in reference to the matter.We now enclose you sketches from the plan of the Niagara Harbor and Dock Company's property filed on the 14th of May 1870- which clearly shows the ---- and bounds of the respective properties of Meneilly and Milloy. We also enclose you copies of the descriptions in the deeds from Galt and Cayley as trustees to Meneilly dated 17th June 1870 and in the deed from the Trustees office Hon. Adam Crooks to Mr. Milloy dated 22nd March 1888.You will observe that in the first deed dated 17th of June 1879 there is no mention of Collingwood St, nor is Collingwood Street designed on the plan of the Dock Company's property, we take it that this street is the one laid out by Meneilly referred to in your letter as a right of way. There is no registered plan showing Collingwood St. The only thing from which the Conveyancer who made the description in the Milloy Deed could get to a street of that name is an Atlas of the Counties of Lincoln and Welland.By H.B. Page(page 2)Which was gather up in 1876 but which apparently is not very authentic in fact it is a very unreliable book in regard to places generallyIt purports to be based on the most reliable information but it certainly fails to give correct information in regard to any plan and description we now enclose, you will be to make out what are -ights respectively of Meneilly and Milloy in regard to land covered by what is designated Collingwood St.Mr. Currie the Registrar who know this property well for years past, and who camped with the local battalion not far from it, and traversed every foot of it for years back, says that the fence you refer to can only have been built a very few years, certainly not long enough to bar Mr Meneilly under the statute.

In both cases it was whiskey that was purchased. Also of note is that on May 18, a quart of whiskey was picked up at the still house. This tells us that Chisholm owned, or at least had interest in a still in Niagara. Stills were shut down in 1814 because the grain used in the distillation was required for flour to feed the troops and First Nations allies and families.Another Interesting Note on this Receipt:This receipt was written on paper that was manufactured for the British Military and should not have been used for non-government purposes. Chisholm, as a militia officer, had access to this paper. Paper was expensive and actually in short supply during the War of 1812.

The next year on the Mississauga Common a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890's golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first international Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course has never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long, a score card states that it is a bogey 82 (no mention of par).

1880,,,,,,,,circa 1880,Invitation,"Blank invitation for an event at the Queens Royal Hotel called the Season's Hops.Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara. The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished. In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity. A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/9895355.jpg,,989.5.355,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/9895355.jpg,,"Dancing, Queens Royal Hotel, Hotels, Tourism",

1950,,,,,,,,ca. 1950,Painting,"Framed oil on canvas painting by Mary Heward Jones, artist and potter; resident of Niagara-on-the-Lake. Titled: View of Fort Niagara from Canadian side.Mary Jones was one of the founding members of the RJR pottery group along with Bill Richardson and Dr. Bruce Riggs.RJR Pottery was produced in Niagara-on-the Lake between 1950 and 1964. The pottery was produced as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any of the pieces. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr Bruce Rigg office and at a home on King Street.Fort Niagara is located on the eastern side of the Niagara River opposite Niagara-on-the-Lake. First built in 1678, the fort is now dominated by the 'French Castle' which was built in 1726.

The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America.

Girls were often taught only arithmetic or reading-if their parents could afford to pay for their schooling-along with other skills that were considered to be ""female accomplishments"". This included manners, sewing, painting, music and comportment. Samplers are therefore the most tangible evidence of female education during the early years of Niagara history. To prepare a young girl for the responsibility of sewing for her future family, girls completed at least two samplers. The first, called a marking sampler, was completed when a girl was around 5 or 6 (sometimes older) and served two purposes: to teach basic embroidery and numbers and the alphabet. This sample which was started by Ann Woodruff at around 1800 is a great example of a marking sampler.

He says John should visit him as the is a pure water establishment, ""something like the Stevenson House"". Blake mentions his children, Herb and Ada. He talks of the extreme hot weather, 104 in the shade at the time of writing. Blake writes about unloading self loading rifles sent by Clark(?) from Washington. These rifles shoot 16 times without taking them from the shoulder. They are as accurate as those used in Canada and much handsomer. Blake saw a large lot of Buffalo skins come in from the praries and he wished he'd been among them with one of those riles.He writes of Mrs. Cittenden and family enjoying their visit to the farm. He is sorry that Deal Smith is in poor health and says that she should be taking lots of ale and porter. He writes that he is pleased that the stone has been put up but wishes he knew what the freight and charges were. (Assume this stone is for Blake's first wife, Gertrude who died in 1863)He mentions that he does not know why his uncle Sam Stocking has visited his mother and children again. Blake writes about the place he is in that, the only thing to do is buy land and raise stock. Blake is concerned that Sam Stocking should ""sell the milk so I can get my money"". Blake writes that he needs the money so he can send some to his mother to buy shoes for Mary. He suggests that the shoes be bought at Welsh's on credit. Clark has arrived and Blake and Clark will be starting out very soon. He says that his mother should write to him every week and it will be forwarded to him. Blake says that he will not have any chance to write to her. Blake tells his mother that he does not intend to go into the army. Blake says that Aunt Sally says Aunt Liddy's cancer is better. Aunt Sally wants Uncle John to come to Roscoe. He can go from Buffalo to Chicago on a steam boat for $9.00 U.S. and from there to Roscoe for 2 or 3 dollars. Blake talks of Clark getting the Rail Road going and if it succeeds it will open up a large tract of country. He then writes about how expensive everything is, as compared to Buffalo. He writes about his children's health. He asks that his uncle give his regards to Henderson and Milloy. He then talks about the deer and prairie chickens that are so plentiful for shooting. He says he could fill the whole of Niagara with deer and chickens by himself. He complains that he is not getting replies to his letters. He asks that Agg take good care of Phils (his dog). He says the dog would be of great value to min and if he came again he would bring him even if it cost $100.00.

In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course.

Translation:Grand River, 6 April 1832Dear Sir, I recieved your line from Mr Burns today and we walked over the intended farms & he seemed to be very well satisfied with it. As for the house I think the cheapest plan would be to move my blockhouse from the flats where we formerly lived as before the flood of the river to the place required, the cost would be as near as I can estimate. Taken it down rafting & drawing it on the spot $4. Raising or laying it up again $3. Required 4000 shingles 25 lbs. nails and take the boards out of the stone house for the floors [then?] so this part of a [fence?] would be saved.The oxen & a cow I expect could be purchased but not without the money & pork & flour also can not be got short of the money. He would also require farming implements [such] as, plough, harrow, 1 chain [etc?]. The articles Mr. Burnham took over I did not take the invoice for it was sent away in a hurry thinking the snow was going to leave [us?] The jackets were considerably cut up by mice while remained in the store. After Mr. Burnham returned I took sick with rheumatism so it drained all my [limbs?] crooked. It is only about ten days ago since I got about. I afterward neglected all business but I must make up loss time at the next Court of Request, then I will send you many.If you choose I will [sign] and furnish you with oxen for that waggon I owe you, The house ought to be built soon if your man Friday intends to commence work this spring so you may let me know your intentions [???] next [Month?] I understand that Mr. Street has purchased all Mr. Jones tract of Land here which will be all settled soon.I am, Dear Sir, Yours Truly, John Norton",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/2012012072.jpg,,2012.012.072,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2012012072.jpg,,"Grand River, Native History",

1823,,,,,,,,4/2/1823,Letter,"A letter to Joseph Brant Clench from John Brant requesting a copy of the speech that William Claus, Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, gave on February 6, 1823 to the Five Nations in Council. Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe had proclaimed in 1793 that the members of the Six Nations did not hold title to the land (the Haldimand Track) and could not as individuals sell their land without permission of the Crown. Joseph Brant and many Chiefs took exception to this. Several Blocks were sold to outsiders by Joseph Brant on reluctant agreement of Peter Russell, Administrator of the government of Upper Canada, in 1797. Brant was eventually forbidden to sell more lands, but he had partially gotten around this by issuing 999-year leases. When Brant died in 1807, the majority of the Haldimand Tract was still in Six Nation's hands. In 1820-21, John Brant and Robert Johnson Kerr tried to get permission to sell their lands without Government approval. The Imperial Government (presumably the ""Secretary of the State for the Colonies"") granted them this opportunity only if the Council of Six Nations unanimously agreed. The colonial officials in Upper Canada and William Claus were shocked that this was granted. The speech that is being referenced in this letter occurred when Claus addressed the Council of Chiefs in August 1822, at which time he warned the chiefs that if they were to sell their lands as freeholders, they would no longer receive the annual 'King's Bounty', and like all enfranchised male citizens in the province, they would be required to serve in the militia, pay taxes, and maintain the roads/bridges in their community. Claus also warned them that if they sold more of their lands, the future of the Indigenous settlement on the Grand River would be doomed.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/2018010004.jpg,,2018.010.004,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/thumbs/2018010004.jpg,,Fort George Speech Five Nations Indian First Nations Indian Affairs Indian Department,

1814,,,,,,,,"3rd May,1814",Letter,"This letter from John Clark at Fort George to Major Jacob Ten Broeck of the 4th Regiment of the Lincoln Militia in Grantham discusses the shortage of men at the Fort. In this letter, Clark reports that when Captain Nelles' company of the 4th Lincoln was called out for active service at Fort George he showed up with only 7 men, claiming that the remainder of his company were cutting timber for the government elsewhere. Clark was upset by this when he expected a full company of around 50 men to report for duty at Fort George and in effect threatened Major Ten Broeck. It was important to have the militia work on the fortifications at Fort George and new Fort Mississauga then under construction. Getting these places into a defensible shape was crucial, as was proven in July when the Americans invaded yet again and marched to the Town of Niagara following their victory at the Battle of Chippawa. The forts were sufficiently strong to prevent the Americans from attacking and recapturing Niagara.Clark wrote that ""in future two companys (sic) will be required to serve for Seven days."" He then stated that if more men did not readily respond when called out for duty then ""we will call for the whole Regiment and keep them out until the service required is performed."" This goad undoubtedly spurred Ten Broeck to ensure that sufficient ""volunteers"" answered the call when required to prevent the whole regiment, every man between the ages of 16 to 60, from being forced to serve.Throughout the War of 1812, companies of normally around 50 militia men from the various regiments were called out by the British for active service for labour, to serve on guard duty, to transport supplies by wagon or bateau, to man sentry stations and, in dire emergencies, to fight alongside the British Regulars. Normally, these companies of men would be called out for relatively brief periods of time, a week or two normally, and would be relieved by another company. This ensured that the work was done while enabling the sedentary militia to carry on with their regular civilian pursuits. The provision of livestock and produce throughout the war was essential for feeding the troops on duty and the Native allies and their families.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/004/2006036003.jpg,,2006.036.003,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/004/thumbs/2006036003.jpg,,War of 1812War of 1812-14Lincoln Militia4th Lincoln Militia,

This is 3 weeks before the Battle of Fort George. The District Order referred to has not yet been located. However, news of the Capture of York on April 27th had reached Fort George at 1:00 a.m. on April 29 and it is suspected that this District Order was related to that event. Brigadier General John Vincent, in command at Fort George, expected the next American move to be an attack on the Head of the Lake to secure the position at Burlington Heights, thereby threatening British communications with the Grand River by cutting the overland route from Burlington Bay to the interior. He expected that the Americans would then attack Fort George in a pincer movement across the Niagara River and from the Burlington vicinity. Following the American capture of York, many of the militiamen of York District had sought out the Americans to offer their ""paroles,"" promises to not fight against the Americans in exchange for their freedom to go about their civilian activities unhindered.

Soldiers from the rank of ensign (2nd Lieutenant) upwards received a Queen's Commission (or King's depending on the time period) for each promotion to a higher rank. Adam Konkle (aka Conkle) was a private during the War of 1812 but was gazetted as an Ensign in 1822, Captain in 1831, major in 1847 and finally was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the 3rd Battalion of Lincoln Militia in 1858. These commissions were the formal documents granting the rank to which he had been promoted. His name was also published in the Government Gazette. It was said that a man was ""gazetted"" on a certain day, seniority within that rank being determined by the date of the commission. Transcription is as follows:""Sir Peregrine Maitland, Knight Commander of the most Honorable Military Order of the Bath, Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Upper Canada and Major General commanding His Majesty's forces therein, etc., etc., etc.To Adamn Conkle, Gentleman.

1814,,,,,,,,7/26/1814,Manuscript,"The first part of the document is a general order of Lt. General Drummond, thanking troops and militia for their gallantry at the battle of Lundy's Lane. He offers particular admiration for the efforts of several regiments (89th Regiment, 41st Light Company, detachments of the 8th or King�s regiments, 104th regiment and the incorporated militia - 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th Lincoln and 2nd York, etc). This section is signed by Lieut. - Colonel J. Harvey, the Deputy Adjutant General, in July 1814 at the Head Quarters Falls of Niagara. The document also includes a list of officers killed, wounded and missing including Lt. mcdougal who is recorded as ""mortally"" wounded. It also lists the officers taken prisoner. This section was signed by E. Baynes, the Adjutant General. A transcript of the document follows; ""Head Quarters Falls of Niagara 26th July 1814 D.G. Order Lieutenant General Drummond offers his sincerest and warmest thanks to the Troops and Militia engaged Yesterday for their exemplary steadiness, gallantry, and discipline in repulsing all the efforts of a numerous and determined Enemy to carry the Position of Lundy's Lane near the Falls of Niagara. Their exertions have been crowned with complete Success by the defeat of the Enemy, and his retreat to the Position of Chippawa with the loss of 2 of his Guns and an immence(sic) number of felled and wounded and several hundred Prisoners. When all have behaved nobly, it is unnecessary to hold up particular instances of merit in Corps or Individuals. The Lieutenant General cannot however refrain from expressing in the strongest manner his admiration of the gallantry and Steadiness of the 89th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Morison, and Major Clifford who ably and Gallantly supported the Lieutenant Colonel's place after he was wounded; 41st Light Company under Captain Glen, and detachments of the 8th or King's Regiments under Captain Campbell; and Royals acting with them, also a party of Incorporated Militia by whom the brunt of the action was for a considerable time sustained and whose loss has been severe To the advance under Lieutenant Colonel Pearson consisting og the Glengarry Light Infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Battusby; a small aprty of the 104th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Drummond; the Incorporated Militia under Lieutenant Colonel Robinson; and the detachment from the 1st, 2nd,4th, and 5th Lincoln Militia and 2nd York, under Lieutenant Colonel Perry, 103rd Regiment; the Lieutenant General offers his warmest thanks. They are also due to the Troops which arrived under Colonel Scott during the action. Viz. the 1st Royal Scotts under Lieutenant Colonel Gorden; 8th Kings under Major Evinus 103rd Regiment under Colonel Scott, Flank(?) Company 104, with the Norfolk, Oxford, Kent, and Essex Rangers, and Middlesex, under Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton. The admirable steadiness and good conduct of the 19th Light Dragoons under Major Lisle and of the detachment of Royal Artillery under Captain McLaughlin and entitled to particular praise. The latter officer having been badly wounded, the Command of the Artillery devolved to Captain Mackinoche, with whose gallantry and exertions Lieutenant General Drummond was highly pleased. Sergeant Austin who directed the firing of the Congrave Rockets deserves very great credit. To the Officers of the General, and of his personal Staff, To Captain Holland Aid-de-Camp, to Major General Riall Lieutenant General Drummond feels himself greatly indebted for the assistance they afforded him. He has to lament being deprived by a wound early in the action of the services of Major General Riall who was most unfortunately made a prisoner whilst returning from the field by a party of the enemy Cavlary who had a momentary possession of the Road. Lieutenant General Drummond has also to regret the wound which has deprived the Corps of Services of Lieutenant Colonel Morrison 89th Regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Robinson of the Incorporated Militia. In the fall of Lieutenant Morrison of the 104th Regiment serving as deputy Assistant Adjutant General the Service has lost a gallant, intelligent, and meritorious young officer. The Lieutenant General and President has great pleasure in dismissing to their homes the whole of the Sedentary Militia who have so handsomely come forward on the occasion, confident that on any future emergency, their Loyalty will be again equally conspicuous. He will perform a grateful duty in representing to His Majesty's Governement the zeal, bravery and alacrity with which the Militia have co-operated with his Majesty's Troops. Signed J. Harvey, Lieut.

1813,,,,,,,,"19th Sept,1813",Letter,"This is a letter from Aeneas Shaw, Adjutant General of the Militia, to Major Ten Broeck, who commanded the 4th Regiment of the Lincoln Militia. It was written from the military headquarters at 4 Mile Creek on September 17th (or 19th), 1813. Shaw was requesting that Ten Broeck's company rendez-vous at the head quarters. During this time, the Americans were occupying Niagara(Niagara-on-the-Lake) and Fort George. Script in ink on water marked paper ""Britannia"".Transcript reads : ""Head Quarters 4 Mile Creek 17th (or 19th) September 1813 Sir I am directed by His Honor Major General De Rottenburg to desire that you will immediately on the receipt of this assemble the whole of the Regiment under your command for service. It will randezvous at the Head Quarters of this army. I have the honor to be Sir Your most obedient Servant Aenas Shaw Adjt. Gen. Mil. Major Ten Broeck Com. 4th Regiment Lincoln. Addressed ""On Service Major Tenbroeck Commanding 4th Regt. Lincoln AE.S. 12 Mile Creek""Following the American capture of Fort George on May 27, 1813, the British retreated to Burlington Heights. Shortly thereafter, a delaying action on June 6 at Stoney Creek prevented the Americans from attacking the British position at Burlington Heights. The timely arrival of the British fleet with supplies and reinforcements, and the ambush of the Americans at the Battle of Stoney Creek, caused the Americans to withdraw back to the safety of Fort George. On the way back, an American encampment was attacked by the ships of the Royal Navy at the 40 Mile Creek (Grimsby) on June 7. As the Americans retreated to Fort George they were followed by a force of British regulars, Canadian Militia and First Nations allies who subsequently set up a loose siege of Fort George, with encampments on the Four Mile Creek, 12 Mile Creek and the Short Hills. An American attempt to cut off a British piquet (outpost) at Decew's House on the approach to the Short Hills (Thorold) was defeated at the Battle of Beaver Dams on June 24, primarily by First Nations allies from and Seven Nations of Canada from the Province of Lower Canada. The Americans had failed in an attempt to force the British to withdraw to the 40 Mile Creek. For the rest of the summer, the Americans were kept bottled up in Fort George and within a one mile radius of the fort. The British continued to harass American sentry positions and ambush American foraging parties that left the confines of their fortified camp.Because the militiamen helping the British were largely from the agricultural community, it was necessary for the British to rotate the men on active duty during planting and harvest seasons to allow the farmers to get home to plant or harvest their crops. Regiments of militia were rotated, allowed to return to their farms in shifts. The British relied on local produce to feed their troops, the warriors of First Nations allies fighting alongside them, and the families of those warriors.In this letter from Major General Aeneas Shaw, Adjutant General of the Militia, to Major Jacob Ten Broeck of the 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia was ordered to muster his regiment for active duty. Major Ten Broeck was in command of the 4th Lincoln following the death of Lieutenant-colonel Johnson Butler on December 1, 1812. The 4th Lincoln consisted of all men of military age (16 to 60), primarily from Clinton and Grimsby Townships. The men of the 4th Lincoln were to report to the British Headquarters at the Four Mile Creek (Virgil) to join in the siege of Fort George. After a brief period in the British encampment providing sentries, cutting wood and assembling supplies for the army, they were relieved by another regiment of Lincoln Militia and permitted to return to their farms to carry on with the harvest.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/2006036005.jpg,,2006.036.005,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/060/thumbs/2006036005.jpg,,"Lincoln Militia, Four Mile Creek, Virgil, Muster, American Occupation, War of 1812",

,,,,,,,,1980s circa,Print: Photographic,"View of the Gazebo at Queen's Royal Park. Photo taken by John Field.Formerly the location of the Queens Royal Hotel. Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara. The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished. In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity. A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/049/2011036013.jpg,,2011.036.013,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/049/thumbs/2011036013.jpg,,"Gazebo, Queen's Royal Park, Fort Niagara, Niagara River",

The first class hotel became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. There were many activities avaliable at the hotel, including tennis. There was also an annual International Championship Tournament. Five courts could be played at one time. The tennis courts were located parallel to Front St, between Regent St and King St. Other activities avaliable were boating, lawn bowling, and golf.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/9885102.jpg,,988.5.102,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9885102.jpg,,Queen's Royal Hotel,

But that didn't last long. Back then there were no control towers or equipment. So, she had to learn to calculate the wind speed based on how straight the flag would fly. If she could see the crane over by the Port Weller Dry Docks, then she knew there was 3 miles visibility, and that was good for biennial flight review (BFR) flying. One of Blanche's career highlights was accomplishing a solo flight. Blanche spent 28 years of her life working with the Niagara Airport Commission and she worked her way up the ladder. In 1965/66, she became manager of the Flying Club and then worked full-time for the Airport Commission. She eventually became the first female manager of the Niagara District Airport.

1960,,,,,,,,1960 C.,Print:Photographic,"A black and white photograph of the Wilderness Estate home at 407 King Street. The angle is from King Street. This remarkable property�four heavily forested acres in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake---has passed intact through many hands since its origin as a crown grant to a veteran of Butler�s Rangers in 1796.The first private purchaser was Robert Pilkington, a military engineer in the intimate circle of John Graves Simcoe, who assigned Pilkington numerous commissions to erect fortifications and public buildings in Upper Canada. After only a year of ownership, Pilkington conveyed the property in 1799 to Ann Claus, in a most unusual transaction.Ann Claus was the daughter of the colonial magnate Sir William Johnson, the widow of Johnson�s chief assistant in the Indian Department, and the mother of William Claus who in 1796 succeeded John Butler as deputy Indian commissioner for the Six Nations reserve. According to the records, the purchase money was obtained by the sale of reserve land, the tribes then conveying the town property to Ann Claus in gratitude for her (deceased) husband�s ""many kindnesses"", a piece of business which could have been transacted only with the permission and guidance of her son William, the financial trustee of the Six Nations.William built the first house, but it was destroyed by the American army in 1813, when its root cellar provided winter refuge for the family of an officer at Fort George. The house was rebuilt, and William lived there until his death in 1826. He often received his Indian wards there, who camped by the banks of One-Mile-Creek, which flows through the property. The present house consists of considerable extensions upon the original 1816-17 construction, and is shielded from view by a forest which includes some extraordinarily tall and broad trees, some of them centuries old. Claus was a pioneering arborist, who planted the very tall stand of sycamores which line the property on its King Street boundary. He also introduced soft-fruit cultivation to Niagara, with an orchard of nectarines and peaches; today, only a single ancient pear tree survives from that orchard. Claus left diaries recording not only the progress of the building, but also the planting of flowers, trees, and vines in the extensive groundsIn the 1850�s the property was sold to yet another family prominent in the pioneer annals of Niagara, the Dicksons. Walter H. Dickson was the only son of Niagara�s richest man, William Dickson, whose magnificent home was burned in 1813 when Walter was seven, and William was away in a prisoner of war camp. The family fortune began with trade, but grew mightily through land speculation throughout the province, and Walter lived as a lawyer and Conservative politician until his appointment to the first Canadian Senate, in 1867. After his death in 1885, the property passed out of his family.In 1919 the property, known as the Wilderness, was bought by W.R. Austin, whose daughter Mrs. Parker became owner in 1925.

Located within the military reserve it was used for military purposes or rent for non-military uses up until Confederation. After Confederation theses lands and buildings became the nucleus of summer military training at Camp Niagara. By 1947 most of the buildings were demolished.

Shepherd and his son Howard, moved their plant to NOTL in 1940. This custom boat building company created quality mahogany boats that became popular in North America during the 1950s. Becoming a leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure boats, the company saw a major boom in production during the 1950s. Construction time took from 2-12 weeks, depending on the boat model. In the 1960s, the plant, now owned by Trojan Boat Company, turned production to large motor yachts. Business continued to increase, but production was moved to the United States in 1978 for cost savings. The last Shepherd boat built in Town was a 54-foot yacht called the Ozark Star.

To the people of Niagara-on-the-Lake, his business was known as ""Field Drugs"" and his window displays featured toiletries, cosmetic and hair products sold at the location. When Erland's health declined in 1964 he closed the pharmacy, and in 1965, he had made sure that the Niagara Foundation and the Ontario College of Pharmacists had the first right to purchase the property; which was owned by the Niagara Foundation until the Ontario Heritage Foundation acquired the property, restored it and opened it as a museum in 1971. Today the Apothecary still operates as a Museum that is run by the Ontario College of Pharmacists. Erland Field was born and raised in Virgil, Niagara-on-the-Lake and attended the High School located on Castlereagh Street.

The steamship 'Cayuga' was the last of the cruise vessels to ply Lake Ontario.

There is no stamp and no cancellation.Cayuga (1906-1957)The SS Cayuga was the longest serving ship of the fleet and was the most profitable. Built at a cost of $266,137, this propeller driven ship was 377 feet long and could carry 2,500 people as well as horses, wagons, vehicles, fruit and supplies.It was the most popular of fleet, sometimes referred to as the ship of romance for the many who met their future husbands/wives on its travels and for the many proposals on the ship that had moonlight cruises and dances.Each summer on its first voyage of the season, children and parents from Niagara were invited for a free trip up the Niagara River to Queenston and back.After WWII, it was renovated and refitted but its popularity diminished. CSL ceased its service and after a short stint with a new owner, the last voyage was in 1957. Low ticket sales and increased debt were responsible for the Cayuga's failure. In 1961 she was scraped at Hamilton. It was believed that more than 15 million people travelled on the ship during its lifetime.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/049/2006018014.jpg,,2006.018.014,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/049/thumbs/2006018014.jpg,,SS Cayuga,

How is the Plan to be Carried Out?In general the pamphlet mentions that in the America's we tend to worship the perpetual changes inherent in a continental policy of progress at all cost. Much historical, architectural and cultural value has been destroyed in the transition from wilderness to civilization. This pamphlet proposes that we try and salvage what is left. The history of Niagara-on-the-Lake in the 20th Century transitioned from the boom times up and into the 1920's, followed by an economic down time which did not improve until the late 1950's. In 1945 when this plan was written the town was still relatively untouched since the 1920's, the ideas proposed in this pamphlet if executed would help preserve historical, architectural and cultural values in Niagara-on-the-Lake.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/074/9854166(a_b).jpg,,985.4.166(A&B),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/074/thumbs/9854166(a_b).jpg,,"Second World War, Niagara preservation and restoration 1945",

The congregation of St. Andrew's Church was established by 1794, possibly earlier. The Gleaner of 1831 states that the first church was on the site of the present church. The original church was destroyed as the American forces retreated from the town and set it ablaze in 1813. Construction of the present Church of St. Andrew's began on May 31st, 1831. James Cooper was the architect of the building; it mirrors the New England influence on many of the homes that were built in town after the War of 1812. Members of St. Andrew's Church are treated to one of the most stunning pulpits in the area. The pulpit and sounding board were fashioned by John Davidson, a local joiner and were a gift from member and benefactor, John Young. When the new church was complete, pews went to the highest bidder. The least expensive pew went for �8 and the most expensive went to Jared Stocking for �40.As a child Betty was encouraged by her parents to pursue her artistic skills.

The house is situated on two acres of orchards and gardens. This was built as a 'summer home' and is only being winterized by the current owners. The house is a two-story structure of neo-classical design, flanked by two single storey verandah wings. Lansing sold the house to Mr. Findlay of Kansas City for $7000 in 1894. It was then sold for $4000 to Edwin Thomas. Thomas already had an established bicycle company when he ventured into automobile production. In 1908 the ""Thomas Flyer"" won the New York to Paris Race. This spiked sales of the car but the company lasted only until 1912. Two other American families have owned the home for the remaining years.

1920,,,,1935,,,,1920-1935,"Print, Photographic","Originally located at Picton and Davy Streets, Richard Moffat, Junior purchased this land from James Crooks in 1834. The next year he built the Inn, one of 28 taverns in Town at the time. Carpentry and boatbuilding were the trades that ran in their family and this may be why the family settled here in the first place in the 1830s- to assist with the Niagara Harbour and Dock Company. Moffat's Inn is an example of the simple, ordered vernacular of Upper Canada in this period, with a centre door. Clapboard was the original finish and stucco was added later. The stagecoaches for Hamilton, St. Catharines and Fort Erie stopped at this hotel daily in the mid-1800s. A livery stable was also connected with the house. Immediately on the corner was Miller's Hotel, which was also built in 1835. By the end of the century, this building, along with the original Moffat Inn, were purchased by James Doyle and were renamed Doyle's Hotel. Doyle had started his hotel career by working for Mrs. Moffat at four dollars/month. He was known to be a ""kindly and helpful man who worked himself up from nothing"". Doyle tore the Miller building down in the 1930s. The Moffat still operates as an Inn today and is owned by Vintage Hotels.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/049/2004002039.jpg,,2004.002.039,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/049/thumbs/2004002039.jpg,,,

1916,,,,1918,,,,1916-1918,Mask:Gas,"The First World War is an arresting demonstration of the conflict between traditional tactics and new technology. Commanders ordered soldiers to dig trenches to hold ground, and charge the enemy head on in order to advance. Facing newly developed machine guns, fighter planes and tanks, this policy led to an unprecedented number of casualties for both sides. In the spring of 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, allied soldiers would be introduced to yet another technological development: Chlorine Gas. At 5:00PM on April 22nd 1915, German troops released Chlorine gas on the French 45th Algerian Division, positioned to the left of the Canadian line at Ypres. While most of the gas missed the Canadians, the French retreat created a large gap in the defensive line that had to be filled by the outnumbered Canadians. Fighting to hold the position, the Canadians faced a direct Chlorine Gas attack two days later. Though the Canadians were able to hold the position until reinforcements arrived, the battle cost the lives of 6,000 Canadians in their first major engagement of the war. It was in this environment that the first gas masks were produced.The threat of poison gas remained, and different methods of protecting soldiers from Chemical warfare were developed. Featured here is a German Lederschutzmaske from 1917. It is composed of an all-leather face piece, glass lenses, and rubber and cloth straps which run along the back to ensure a secure fit. The chemical filter is directly attached, differentiating it from the Allied 'small box respirator' style of mask in which the filter was carried in a satchel, worn on the back and away from the face. The German design made the mask less cumbersome, but it was known to reduce the soldier's ability to fire his weapon accurately. Respirators on the mask were also known to wear out faster than their Allied counterparts, and the leather sections, used due to economic shortages, often failed under high concentrations of gas. Although details of this mask's journey are unknown, it is likely that it made its way to Canada as part of a collection of war souvenirs. Trophies of the conflict were in great demand, with soldiers searching for weapons, clothing and equipment, to bring back as mementos of their actions overseas. Nearly 100 years later, souvenirs such as this one still serve as solemn reminders of the sacrifices that were made and of the challenges that Canadian soldiers faced during the conflict.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/035/fa691119.jpg,,FA69.1119,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/035/thumbs/fa691119.jpg,,"First World War, Great War, WWIMilitary",

The Women's Institute members then sewed over the autographs in red thread and outlined memorable buildings of the town.

1914,,,,1917,,,,1914-1917,Print:Photographic,"A portrait photograph of Captain Edwin Shepherd in uniform. ""Edwin Shepherd or Ted as he was familiarly called, was the eldest son of Magistrate Edwin Shepherd and Mrs. Shepherd. He was one of those rare men who never lost the vision splendid. He had not lived in Niagara for over twenty years, but on his rare visits one could see the indomitable spirit shining through his clear eyes. In his presence, was always confidence both in his goodness and strength. None of his friends were surprised when they learned that he had thrown up everything and was entering heart and soul into enlisting a Company to take overseas with him. For many years, he had taken an interest in Military affairs and had taken the Officer's Course in Toronto He was in his military days, attached to the 23rd and then to the 98th Algonquins. When the 159th was formed, he joined that and himself recruited almost every man in the Company. He received his majority in Camp Bordon. He was offered a fine position in England but he had gone over to fight and so reverted and went to France as a Lieutenant. He writes from France:- My men are fine brave fellows; there is a great wonderful love between us and our men. They look to us as a father and we love them as they were our own sons and do everything possible for them. It is a wonderful idea, brotherly love. We have a splendid lot of Officers in our Company, such fine, gentlemanly, happy fellows. In a letter dated Sept. 10, 1917, he wrote: ""I am very lonesome tonight, I am all that is left of the Company of Officers. It is hard to part with a bunch of good fellows. I have three of my platoon yet. I feel ""like one who treads along some banquet hall deserted."" His great gift of love, and appreciation of others did not pass unacknowledged. Let me quote a paragraph from a letter to Mrs. Shepherd from a private soldier, personally unknown to her -- ""I first knew your husband when he commanded a Company in the 159th Battation at Camp Borden, where he earned the respect and regard of not only his own, but those of the entire unit. When I came to France, he was second in Command of a Company in this Battalion and as I am employed in the Battalion Orderly Room, I have a good opportunity of learning with what favour he was regarded by the Officer Commanding the Battalion.He had in his Company, many of the men of the old 159th and they were with him when he died. He led those men who knew and trusted him so well over the parapet at 5:40 in the morning of the 26th of this month (October, 1917) in an attack which has been described by the old soldiers of the unit, as the most brilliant in its history and which under the condition of mud, rain, cold, wind and murderous fire from the Enemy, was a phenomenal piece of work. It will I know, be some consolation to you and your family to know that your husband died facing the enemy, and showing that example of coolness and bravery which made the reputation of Canadians as fighting men what it is today. When a man has to die in this game, it is a mercy for him to be killed instantly as Mr. Shepherd was. To lie wounded, and to lie out in the mud of Flanders in these cold October days is to die more deaths than one. Another sentence in the same letter read:- ""A few months ago, Mr. Shepherd obtained from me a list of the old 159th men in the Battalion as he said he wished to forward it to North Bay with the idea of providing the boys with a Christmas box. It was this regard for his men which made him so popular and which will make his loss so felt. These words, unsolicited and unofficial, are a fine tribute.Letters from friends among the Officers tell the same story. They all tell of his cheerfulness and fine spirits, his coolness and bravery and his thought for the welfare of his men. Seven times before this he had led his men over the top. This time, a sniper's bullet got him when about fifty yards over. Quoting from a letter - He died as a hero leading victorious troops who gathered at the front from which they went after and they were the only outfit to carry their object that day. It is hard not to quote many more of these letters, but I will just take a sentence or two from that of his friend, a Chaplain of the Battalion. - Just before he went up the line, he attended Holy Communion. I know from conversation with him that his confidence and trust were placed in God. What a comfort at such a time, as this to be able to leave our loved ones in God's care and keeping - He is gone - What fairer death could we wish him or what nobler heritage could he leave to his sons than the record of such a life and death. A few days after word was received of his death, he was gazetted Captain.""Niagara Historical Society, No. 34, ""Whose Debtors We Are"", (1923), p. 18-20.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/058/991024-2.jpg,,991.024,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/058/thumbs/991024-2.jpg,,,

When the Society began collecting artefacts of significant interest, several people doubted the Society�s ability, believing that everything had been given away or destroyed, or that no one would either give or lend anything for such a purpose. Fortunately, the�Society�ignored these sentiments. The early collection produced artefacts of both local and national interest, many of which are still�preserved�by the�society�s Museum. The society was always searching for a way to memorialize the United Empire Loyalists�who settled in Niagara.�In 1898, the notion that this memorial�could take the form of a building to house the society�s collection�was�first�introduced. By 1903,�with�the collection�at over 2,000 items, the�society�began planning the construction of this building. It�would be called Memorial Hall.Janet spearheaded the fundraising campaign�and the society managed to successfully raise�($4,924.78)�95% of the costs, only managing to borrow $275 from the bank, which was paid off 2 years later. On June 4, 1907 the Society opened the�first purpose-built museum in Ontario, which to this day is�still�apart�of the Museum complex.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/022/994046.jpg,,994.046,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/022/thumbs/994046.jpg,,,

Seeing that when the bell buoy was ranged I could scarcely understand why the steamer ""Chippeaw"" was so far distant from the buoy on her incoming trip so I am glad that you are fully satisfied as to the ranges being now perfectly correct. I may say that so far as I can ascertain in the Department that the preparations are being made for the establishment of the range lights and fog alarm as early as possible and which are now under the Construction branch.Yours truly,W.H.

This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. There were many activities avaliable at the hotel for guests including fishing, golf, tennis, lawn bowling, a bathing beach, an orchestra.

There is no message.Hotel Chautauqua/Strathcona, c. 1887Built on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement, a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants� quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/039/2007007017.jpg,,2007.007.017,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/039/thumbs/2007007017.jpg,,"Chautauqua, Hotel, Vacation, Tourism",

Al Derbyshire wrote, ""My first recollection of Lancelot Cressy Servos is when he would visit his mother who lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake just across the street from my residence. Although he did not live in Niagara he did visit quite often. On several occasions I would see him going to the golf course with a couple of clubs and some golf balls. I would follow him and watch him hit good shots to the green hoping some day I would be able to hit golf balls as well as he did. I was only in my early teens at the time.Although there is no evidence of him ever having been a member of the Royal Niagara Golf Club, as it was known at that time, he was associated with the Club and in the early 1900's donated the Servos Trophy for competition by the men. This trophy is still being played for.Although he was a Canadian, most of his work concerning golf took place in the United States, mostly in Florida. He designed several of the oldest courses and, as stated in his book, which is reputed to be the first book on golf written in Canada, he would visit there, join up with other golf professionals and play a round. He says the merchants at that time would close their shops and go out to watch these professional golfers play.Mr. Servos starts his book with the following. Quote 'Time marches on. Man Conspires, respires, aspires, and expires. During which sojourn, if he is fortunate, he plays a little golf and perspires. He may get so that he plays it very well. Or he may not be able to play it as well as he would like. It is for those who would like to improve their golf that this book is published. For what gaineth a man if he acquire the whole world and yet in unable to play golf.'""",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/2004007007(ae).jpg,,2004.007.007(A-E),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/thumbs/2004007007(ae).jpg,,,

The first one was formed by William Kirby, a respected author and historian, in 1892, but it was short lived. Janet Carnochan was chosen as the Niagara Historical Society President, much to her surprise and reluctance, and she served as Society President for 30 years. Under her guidance the organization built up a collection of artifacts, starting in 1896, related to this historic town and the Niagara Peninsula. She even had the forethought to commission a local artist to produce paintings of the town which now show buildings that no longer exist. Many of the Museum's most prized possessions arrived under her leadership. The current Memorial Hall, owned by the Society, is the first purpose-built museum in Ontario, and was erected largely due to Janet's efforts.

Of note are two churches in the centre of the picture. The white church in the foreground is the original Welseyan Methodist Meeting House built in 1862. In 1925 it became part of the United Church of Canada. The church was moved to the intersection of the Niagara Parkway and Dumfries Street in 1958. In 1997 the congregation joined the St.David's United church. In turn the building was donated to the Niagara Parks Commission. In 2011 the church was moved to it's present location on the grounds of the Laura Secord Homstead. Today it is used primarily as a wedding chapel and known as the Queenston Chapel.Behind the Methodist church can be seen the Queenston Baptist Church. Built in the Gothic Revival Style between 1842-1845 with rough cut limestone. Load bearing walls 2 feet thick support the gable roof. Three gothic windows on the north and south side amd 2 windows in front. Closed as a church in 1918, sold to the Women's Institute in 1928, occupied and used by the Institute until 1954. It remained unoccupied and idle until it was purchased by a local resident in 1967, then donated in 1970 to the town of Niagara on the Lake. Renovated and opened in Dec 1972 as the Queenston Library and Community Centre. The building was restored at this time to it's 1928 appearance, minus the steeple. It is believed the wooden steeple in the front part of the building was removed when the Women's Institute made the necessary repairs and renovations when the building was purchased in 1928.

It all began when a British force (including Canadian and Native men) or near 2000 men, under the guidance of Major-General Phineas Riall, attacked an invading American army of about 3,500 men under the guidance of Major-General Jacob Brown. The fighting started early in the morning and lasted until well into the evening. When it was over, the British were forced to withdraw and the Americans won the day. Three weeks later, the invaders were turned back at the bloody battle of Lundy's Lane, fought on 25 July, 1814.The Battle of Chippawa cost the lives of nearly 200 men, and most of those men are thought to have been burried right on the battle site.

The Amphitheatre was built to seat 3,000 people, with room for an additional 1,000 should it be necessary.Hotel Chautauqua/Strathcona, c. 1887Built on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement, a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants� quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/047/2000047.jpg,,2000.047,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/047/thumbs/2000047.jpg,,"Chautauqua, Niagara Assembly",

The British erected the first Lighthouse on the Great Lakes here in 1804 and constructed a small gun battery nearby for defensive purposes. When the Americans declared war on the British during the war of 1812, the British underestimated the threat and did little to strengthen their defences in Niagara (now Niagara-on-the-Lake). During the Fenian uprisings (1865-66), it was occupied by militia but was considered obsolete by that time and was little used until being abandoned in 1867.

The next year on the Mississauga Common a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890's golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first international Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course has never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long, a score card states that it is a bogey 82 (no mention of par).

Tunnels were dug into the cement to remove the material and install 3 to 6 kilns. The cement was fired and then packed into wooden barrels for sale. This natural cement was needed during the building of the Welland Canal as motar between the large cut stone blocks. Unreliable as a building material it was eventually replaced by Portland Cement in the early 1900's which had a more stable cement that set faster. The Cement Works closed in 1905. Queenston Quarries was established in 1837 and is among the oldest quarries in Canada.

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants� quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages.

When the sewing of the patches was completed the quilt was often embellished, sometimes these embellishments began after the maker's death, and included elaborate embroidery, beads, lace, dried flowers and even painted designs. The style of quilt hit its craze in the late Victorian era when quilting started to morph from a necessary domestic task to a leisure activity. A great example of the Crazy Quilt style in the collection is a Crazy Quilt made from pieces of embroidery completed by Laura Secord. The quilt was compiled by Augusta Smith, Laura's granddaughter. Note that the quilt was never completed. The butterfly embroidered on the quilt is very reminiscent of a drawing (988.294) that was done by Laura Secord and copied by Miss. Goring.It is not clear if all the embroidery on the quilt was made by Laura or if her granddaughter had a hand in adding her own personal touches to the quilt. According to Janet Carnochan and her research (NHS 25), Laura was always very kind and thoughtful to children and to many of the old soldiers, who had served with her husband. She was very fond of gardening, and the flowers embroidered on this quilt may reflect this passion.

The rifle had been adopted by the British army and Canadian militia in 1871 and continued in service into the 20th century. It was the first purpose-designed breech loading rifle in the British Army (slightly incorrect - the Ferguson Rifle was produced and used on a very small scale during the American Revolutionary War). It was a combination of the falling block mechanism devised by Frederich Martini (1832-97), a Swiss gunsmith and the seven-groove rifling devised by Edinburgh gunsmith Alexander Henry (1817-95). The Martini-Henry was popular with the soldiers because it only weighed 9 lb (4 kg) unloaded, was very robust, easy to strip and clean, and had few and easily replaceable parts.As for Middleton, he was born in Belfast, Ireland, in 1825 and saw service in many parts of the British Empire, including Quebec where he had married Eug�nie Doucet of Montreal. In 1884, he had accepted the normally placid position of General Officer commanding Canada's militia. As a consequence of his victory over the ill-equipped M�tis rebels at the Battle of Batoche (in what is now Saskatchewan) on 12 May 1885, and the capture of their leader Louis Riel three days later, Middleton was granted a gift of $20,000 from the Parliament of Canada and given a knighthood by Queen Victoria. He resigned command of the Canadian Militia in 1890 and returned to Great Britain where he was rewarded with the sinecure of Keeper of the Crown Jewels. He died in 1898.""In January 2010 Steven Baxter added these notes on the rifle:Martini-Henry Mk I�IVType: Service riflePlace of origin: United KingdomService historyIn service: 1871�1918Used by: United Kingdom & ColoniesWars: British colonial wars, Second Anglo-Afghan War, Anglo-Zulu War, Boer War, Mahdist War, World War IProduction historyDesigner: RSAF EnfieldDesigned: 1870Manufacturer: VariousProduced: 1871�c.1891Number built: approx. 500,000�1,000,000Variants: Martini-Henry CarbineSpecifications:Weight 8 pounds 7 ounces (3.827 kg) (unloaded), 9 pounds, 4.75 ounces (with sword bayonet)Length 49 inches (124.5 cm)Cartridge: .577/450 Martini-HenryCalibre: .577/450 Martini-HenryAction: Martini Falling Block /Peabody actionRate of fire: 10 rounds/minuteMuzzle velocity: 900 ft/s (270 m/s)Effective range: 600 yd (550 m)Maximum range: 1,500 yd (1,400 m)Feed system: Single shotSights: Sliding ramp rear sights, Fixed-post front sightsThe Martini-Henry saw service in World War I in a variety of roles�primarily as a Reserve Arm, but it was also issued (in the early stages of the war) to aircrew for attempting to shoot down observation ballons and other aircraft.

1853,,,,,,,,1853-JAN.03,List,"This document is a record made by Reverend Francis Lacey/Lacy of the births and deaths for the Baptist Church in 1853. It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855. Sometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a ""coloured"" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the ""Negro Burial Ground"".

1851,,,,,,,,1851-JAN.04,List,"This document is a record made by Reverend Francis Lacey/Lacy of the births and deaths for the Baptist Church in 1850. It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855. Sometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a ""coloured"" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the ""Negro Burial Ground"". Unfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations.

Golfing started in Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1877.Fort Mississauga, (built on Mississauga Point) is located at the mouth of the Niagara River, and residing directly across from this is the American Fort Niagara. From a strategic standpoint, it was an ideal location in times of war for preventing enemy shipping from entering the river. The British erected the first Lighthouse on the Great Lakes here in 1804 and constructed a small gun battery nearby for defensive purposes. When the Americans declared war on the British during the war of 1812, the British underestimated the threat and did little to strengthen their defences in Niagara (now Niagara-on-the-Lake). During the Fenian uprisings (1865-66), it was occupied by militia but was considered obsolete by that time and was little used until being abandoned in 1867.

1840,,,,,,,,1840 C.,Painting:Watercolour,"A watercolour painting of William Dickson by Hoppner MeyerBorn in Dumfries, Scotland in 1769, William Dickson emigrated to Canada at the age of 15. He originally worked for his cousin, Robert Hamilton, the enormously successful Queenston merchant and shipowner whose enterprises were based on the portage route around Niagara Falls. Dickson soon went into business for himself in Niagara, selling supplies to both the military garrison and to the local settlers. By 1790, Dickson had become a successful businessman and is credited with building the first brick house in the Niagara peninsula. In 1794, Dickson married Charlotte Adlam; they eventually had three sons. He was a member of the Niagara Library and of the Niagara Agricultural Society, a trustee of the district grammar school, and a justice of the peace. In 1803, Dickson was given a special license by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada to practise law which he did for a number of years, at times acting as judge of the District Court. During the War of 1812, Dickson was arrested by invading American forces and was being held as a prisoner in Albany, when the town of Niagara was burned in December 1813. Lost in the fire was not only a house recently built on a large tract of land he had purchased south of the Commons but also a magnificent library of 1,000 volumes. As the town began its process of rebuilding following the war, it benefited from the gift of a part of Dickson's land tract upon which the second Courthouse was built. Dickson then turned his attention to his large land holdings along the Grand River.There, he aided a group of Pennsylvania Mennonites in a difficult transaction. He made arrangements with agents in Scotland to encourage immigration to his land. Dickson was known for his paternal treatment of the settlers, advancing large sums of money, not requiring substantial down payments, and ensuring that they had stock, implements, and provisions. Once his settlements were prosperous, Dickson returned to Niagara where he died in 1846.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/988199.jpg,,988.199,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/thumbs/988199.jpg,,,

1825,,,,,,,,1825-40 C.,Uniform:Coat,"Following the War of 1812, Niagara remained a hotbed of military activity. There was concern about republican ideas spreading into Canada and the McKenzie rebellion of 1837 prompted an increased military presence to combat these threats. The 1st King's Dragoon Guards regiment was called from England to help put down the McKenzie uprising and they arrived in Niagara in 1838. A heavy cavalry regiment, The King's Dragoon Guards were renowned for their skill on horseback and their attractive uniforms generated great interest among the citizens in the Niagara area. One recalled the regiment as ""perhaps the finest military body that ever came to the district� officered by men of wealth and title. The men were all six feet in height with fine well-trained horses.""This uniform belonged to one of these imposing men, Sergeant-Major Adam Flanigan. Flanigan was born in 1810 in Ballymena, North Ireland and joined his regiment in Canada in 1840. One of the tasks given to the regiment was the renovation of Fort Mississauga, which probably meant updating its defensive capabilities. While stationed in Niagara, Sergeant-Major Flanigan met and married Agnes Richardson and they settled down to raise a family on Johnson Street in town (Niagara-on-the-Lake). Adam and Agnes were well-known in the local community and had a son William -who died in infancy- and two daughters, Mary and Isabella. At some point in the 1850's Adam broke his hip and was never able to walk again. The Reverend Thomas Creen, rector of St. Mark's Church frequently visited the disabled veteran for company and probably also to administer Church services. Adam died at age 52 and was buried September 16, 1862 in St. Mark's Churchyard in Niagara-on-the-Lake. His uniform jacket, along with his helmet and other accoutrements were donated to the local museum and serve as a striking reminder of the extensive military tradition in the Niagara region.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/029/9729041.jpg,,972.904.1,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/029/thumbs/9729041.jpg,,,
1825,,,,,,,,1825-30 C.,Doll,"This Six Nations doll was donated in 1909.Native children had few toys. Generally native families had only what was essential for their daily lives. Hence games were most popular as they could simply be played with materials found at the sites. What toys they had were made of locally available material and expendable. Indigenous dolls were most often made of cattails, cornstalks and other natural materials found locally.The fact that there are painted features on this doll is notable as most native dolls were faceless as it was feared the doll would turn into the person it represented if too much detail was on the doll. The doll is dressed in the ordinary costume of a Six Nations woman. She is made of wood and papier-m�ch�. The materials are of European influence. Before the introduction of glass beads this native doll would have been decorated with bone shell and stone beads. The cloths used for the clothing are black with a red sash and pants with blue stitching. The hair and eyes are painted brown and the skin pink. The date of this doll is estimated to be in the mid to late eighteen hundreds.This doll belonged to a Chief's daughter on the Grand River and was indeed very much cherished as she is in excellent condition. The doll does not seem to have been ravaged by child's play, but rather admired and carefully handled by her owner.

1824,,,,,,,,1824-AUG.23,Indenture,"William Lyon Mackenzie was born and raised in Scotland, and in 1820 he emigrated to Upper Canada. After being in business for a few years in Dundas, he moved to the village of Queenston in Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1823. Here he became known as a bookseller, grocer, haberdasher, and druggist. Records don't seem to indicate what piqued his interest in politics or the desire to start his newspaper, The Colonial Advocate, but in 1824 he launched his first issue from his home and business in Queenston. The Colonial Advocate was dedicated to political and social reform and promoted responsible government and opposition to the current colonial governing practices that ruled Upper Canada at the time. Mackenzie had been editing his newspaper in the village for about three months, when he decided to lure Hiram Leavenworth, along with his press, printing materials, and typeset to Queenston, to manage the printing on his behalf. Before this, Mackenzie had his bi-weekly paper printed in Lewiston. This document is an agreement between Leavenworth and Mackenzie for the duties, salary, and equipment purchased to begin his Queenston operation. Within one month, Mackenzie's print shop was in full operation in his home, located at 1 Queenston Street. After producing around 20 issues, Mackenzie left Queenston for York (Toronto) in the fall of 1824, and he continued printing his newspaper there. This move was ultimately made from his desire to make a difference politically-and did he ever! He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, but he caused so many issues that he was kicked and elected back in four times! In 1834, the Reformers won a majority on the newly created Toronto City Council, and Mackenzie was elected Toronto's first Mayor. When he was defeated at the polls in 1836, he became very resentful. This is when he began planning the Upper Canada Rebellion, which took place in December of 1837. This rebellion was put down quite quickly, due to poor planning and lack of military experience from the individuals involved. Since his involvement in this insurrection was considered treasonous, there was a warrant out for his capture and arrest. Mackenzie fled from Toronto to the United States. He tried to continue to lead his rebellion from Navy Island located on the Niagara River. Here he organized his own provisional government, and he was able to obtain money and weapons from supporters and sympathizers. The British Military wasn't going to let him off easy. They bombarded Navy Island with cannon fire. Eventually, he and his supporters abandoned the island. Despite the failed rebellion in 1837, Mackenzie was able to spark a flame in many who believed in his democratic ideals. His newspaper, The Colonial Advocate, which started in Queenston, was part of this movement and it helped to sew the seeds of rebellion.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/9875082.jpg,,987.5.082,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/9875082.jpg,,,

Accommodating this civil service required a number of different court house buildings over the years, the first of which was burned to the ground by American forces in December of 1813.

Niagara would lose most of its legal significance in 1862 when the county court was relocated to St. Catharines, with the court house thereafter being used as the Town Hall. A fixture of the building by then, mayors of Niagara used the chair in council meetings until at least 1877, as the chair can be spotted in an 1877 painting of the Hall's interior in the collection of the Toronto Public Library.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/969125-2.jpg,,969.125,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/thumbs/969125-2.jpg,,"Court House, Furniture",

One was the first jail and court house in the present area of King and Prideaux Streets. But by 1815 the war was over. Law and order needed to be maintained and a new jail and court house were required.It was to be built on land in the present Rye, Niagara and Charlotte Street area, donated by William Dickson, the noted local lawyer and politician. It would be out of the range of cannon fire from Fort Niagara, for sure, but Dickson, who owned other land in the area, would have probably seen the potential of a new public building leading to development on his other lands, even though a contemporary observer wondered, in 1818, why such a magnificent building was set in a ""swamp"". The courthouse was the seat of justice in Niagara from 1816 until the late 1860's. A number of key trials took place here, including that of reformer Robert Gourlay in 1819, as well as one for thirteen 1837 rebels who were condemned to death (most of whom were reprieved), along with those of a further assortment of debtors, horse thieves, murderers, and the like. The jail staged many executions, floggings, placing in the pillory and, of course, it housed many convicted (and accused) criminals.In 1869 after a new courthouse was erected on Queen Street in the Town, the building was purchased by Maria Rye and renamed ""Our Western Home"", a home for young girls from England who it was believed in the view of time, has a better chance for a good life in Canada than in the orphanages or amongst the poor families in England. Its use changed over time and it was finally demolished in the 1970's.

1813,,,,,,,,1813-JUL.04,Letter,"A letter from A. Hamilton dated at St. David's to his aunt Mrs. Henderson in Edinburgh regarding the War of 1812.Transcription is as follows:This letter was written in the year of 1813, and addressed to Mrs. Henderson, No. 1, Park Street, Edinburgh. The original bears the stamp of ""Ship Letter"" per ""Mary"".St. Davids, July 4, 1813My dear Aunt,Your last kind letter of the first April, together with the large packet from the boys, came to hand last evening and gave us infinite pleasure. I can easily conceive how anxious you must be to hear from this as such a time, but I assure you that it is almost impossible either to write or to get letters from this when written: this must in some measure excuse our long silence. Many changes of fortune have occured since the commencement of the war, but we are still, thank God, able to keep our heads up, and things at this moment appear again in our favour. The first appearances were rather against us; General Hull of the Americans, crossed the river at Detroit and planted their standard, but short was their triumph. Our gallant General Brock attacked them with a handful of troops, drove them from their entrenchments, and in our turn crossed the river, took possesion of Fort Detroit, when the whole garrison - 2,500 men - as also the territory of Michigan, surrendered to our arms. Brock returned amidst the acclamations of an almost idolizing public.Their next attempt was at Fort Erie. From the great extent of our lines of defence, from Fort Erie to Niagara - 35 miles - with scarcely 1000 regular troops, you may suppose how weak our Guards were. They attacked us in the middle of the night with 500 picked men, sailors, and I am sorry to say most of them our own countrymen, surrounded our small guards and murdered them without mercy, and took possession of three of our batteries - but again their reign was short. Day dawned - the remainder of our small collected and drove them with precipitations into their boats, and took their commander officer and fifty men. This was nothing - our danger only now appeared approaching. An incredible number of boats were drawn up along the opposing shore, the troops all embarked - 5000 men. A few well directed shots from our field pieces, and the alacrity of our re-enforcements, coming in every minute, made them first pause and at last entirely relinquish their plan. Their troops were disembarked and their boats taken as far as possible out of he range of our shots. The business of Queenston you already know; they were again defeated with astonishing loss - one General, two or three Cols., 50 or 60 inferior Officers and 1000 men. General Winchester next fell into our hands in approaching Fort Detroit with 450 men. The command then devolved on General Harrison, who was shortly after attacked by General Proctor, and his Fort on the Miamis invested.A re-enforcement of 1300 men attempted to find their way through our lines to the Fort, in which they succeeded with loss, however, of 500 men taken prisoners.The next appeared on Lake Ontario, with 17 sail of vessels for an attack on York, in which they succeeded with the loss of General Pike, and between three and four hundred men killed, principally killed by the blowing up of our magazine before our retreat, but as if a species of fatality still pursued them, they became afraid of an attack from our Indians and troops. After destroying all the public property they could find, decamped in a few days - took bag and baggage. They then proceeded for Fort George, where from internal enemies, having gained every intelligence of our plan of defence, everything seemed now in their favor. An astonishing thick fog having spread itself over the whole river and lake, by which means they were enabled to place every vessal and boat exactly where they wished them, without our being to annoy them in the least, or even knowing where they were. When the weather cleared up we found ourselves surrounded with boats and vessels on every side. They approached us with boats divisions, each division of which was stronger than our whole force put together. Notwithstanding this fearful odds, our advanced Guards received them at the point of their bayonet, and in several instances forced them again into their boats. Not content with attacking us with their men, they now opened a most destructive fire of grape and cannister from their vessels. Though the action lasted scarecely three-quarters of an hour, out of 500 brave fellows who entered the field, scarcely 200 returned.Finding further resistance quite in vain, our General Vincent, with tears in his eyes, gave the neccessary orders for a retreat, which, in spite of six times our numbers within a few hundred yards of us, was effected without the loss of a single man.We then proceecded to the head of the lake and took up a strong position at that place - our whole force consisting of about 2000 men. They after determined attacking us with 5000 men, two divisions, the first of 3000 arrived within five miles of us, at a place called Stoney Creek, the other within a few miles of them. Having intelligence from a deserter of their intention to attack us early next morning with their whole force, General Vincent called together his Officers, when it was determined to be before hand with them, and attack their front division that night. 800 of our best troops were chosen for this attack, drove them with the bayonet from their position, got possession of three field pieces, and took their two Generals Windsor and Chandler prisoners. They immediately fell back on their rear division, and the whole were making the best of their way to their boats on the lake, when to the astonishment of everybody six vessels appeared in sight under American Colors. They planted the standard on the bank, and gave them three cheers, when suddenly the colors were shifted, and the royal standard was seen flying on the vessel, which together with a few well-directed shots put them into such a condition that they decamped with the utmost precipitation, leaving everything in our hands - 19 boats - with the whole of their tents and camp equipage. They never stopped until they reached Fort George. We followed them in a day or two as far as the Beaver Dams, about 18 miles from their Fort. They determined upon attacking us there, but from our intelligence we were again beforehand with them with 420 men.We were not within a few miles of Fort George. Our troops are every hour advancing, and we are fully determined, although their force is still greatly superior to ours, to make one gallant attempt to drive them from our shores, trusting to that Divine Providence which has hitherto so strongly upheld us. We have no fears. I shall not seal this until we know the events.Robert went up last winter with Mr. Robert Dickson to bring down for our support the North Western Indians, and is expected back every day. Some of the Indians have already arrived. George and myself with Mr. Robertson are attached to Col. DeHearn of the 104th Regiment, who commands the advanced Guards, from our knowledge of the country and roats about the place, to assist him in his movements, etc. James is attached as a Lieutentant to the Incorporative Militia, and is stationed a mile or two from this. It is with the utmsot pleasure, I say, that although one or other of us, sometimes two or three together, have been in almost every action that has taken place, yet that not one of our friends have been hurt. Mr. and Mrs. Clark, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. and Mr. Tom Dickson are all well, the last you will be happy to hear has a daughter, a few days ago, as likewise Mrs. Robert Hamilton, Mrs. C.H. and Son are at York with their friends, both very well. Mr. Robert Murray is still on the American Shore at Presque Isle. We have not heard from him since the commencement of the war, but as he has no hand in this it is to be hoped he will be allowed to remain quietly at home and mind his business.The Americans, upon taking possession of Niagara, allowed the inhabitants to remain in quiet possession of their homes and property, but since their last adverse fortune they have taken up almost every gentlement of respectability and sent them over the river as prisoners of war. You will be sorry to hear Mr. Wm. Dickson is among the number. Mr. T. Dickson had to make his escape in the night. John Robertson, you will be pleased to hear has behaved himself with great propriety, and proved himself a most gallant soldier. His wife and daughter are both well. Owing to a chance in councils at Headquarters, it is determiend that no attack shall be made upon Fort George untill the vessels shall have decided the command of the lakes. James intends writing you after the attack is made. I shall leave it, therefore, to him to give you, I hope good news.Remember me most affectionately to all my friends with you and believe me my dear Aunt,Most sincerely yours, A.

When the capital of Upper Canada was established in Newark (today Niagara-on-the-Lake), Augusta�settled�here�with her family. It was in Niagara where she met�her husband, Thomas McCormick.�Augusta and Thomas lived in Queenston�(1812-1821)�and when�Thomas was appointed as the manager of the Bank of Upper Canada, they moved to what is today�known as�Niagara-on-the-Lake. While not much is known about Augusta, we can�assume that she lived a life of wealth and leisure�based on her father and husband�s�prominent positions within the Niagara community, and from the evidence contained within this letter. In this preserved letter, Augusta writes to her father from her home in Queenston. The letter is dated May 28, 1812 and it details what her life was like just before the outbreak of the War of 1812. Augusta talks about some of the domestic duties she is responsible for, which include her housekeeper and garden. She also sends along local news to her father about the birth of her sisters (Hannah Owens Hamilton) son, Robert Jarvis Hamilton, Mr. Dickson�s health, and that her sister, Eliza (Jarvis) Robison, has sent along cake from Queenston to their father in York (Toronto). Augusta�s letter also indicates that her world is not completely shunned from the rumbles of war brewing. She lets on in this letter that Major-General Brock had arrived in Queenston and that her brother William Munson Jarvis has received a military commission. While it may seem like a simple letter, the information contained within give us a glimpse into what life was like for a middle to upper class woman in Niagara, especially so close to the outbreak of war. The community of Queenston was devastated in just 5 months, when the Battle of Queenston Heights destroyed much of the community.

1805,,,,,,,,1805 C.,Dress,"After decades of wide hips and tightly laced torsos, a shift in fashion occurred at the end of the 1700s. Women's clothing was influenced by the early Greek and Roman style and was made from light-weight fabrics. The waistline rose significantly and sat under the bust to create a straight silhouette. Dresses either had short puffed sleeves or were long and narrow. This silhouette remained through the 1810's, but dresses were now made from heavier textiles. This dress, dated to the late-1700s to ca. 1809, adheres to the fashion of this period as it is made of light weight cotton muslin, features puffed sleeves, and the waistline sits right under the bust, which is a drop front bust. The skirt has a slight train. The documentation on this dress originally stated that it was worn by Anne Smith, the daughter of the First Surveyor General of Upper Canada, D.W. Smith. However, Anne would have been too young to wear a dress of this people. Research indicates that it was likely worn by Jane Isabella (nee Clark) Smith, the wife of Samuel Smith, who was the Administrator of the Province.

1803,,,,,,,,1803-NOV.17,Land Grant,"Grant To Benajah Williams of 100 Acres in Stamford Township from the Crown during the reign of King George the Third.It was issued by Peter Hunter, Second Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.Attached to the grant is a seal with an anchor on one side, and the coat of arms of the United Kingdom on the other.The following we contributed by Bill Williams: Our family bible says that Benajah crossed the border from NY state in 1786. He was the 3rd son of Darius and Rebecca Williams, of �Welch� descent. Benajah settled on 100 acres in Niagara in 1795, with an additional 100 acres added in 1796. I presume these were the tracts described in the land grant? Subsequently in 1805 he moved to Glen Williams where he established a mill in the Credit river. The Stamford survey of 1813, which must have been a hazardous survey given the war in Niagara that year, shows that he owned only 1 of the 2 acreages at that time. Benajah was married three times and had 9 children. He died in Glen Williams in 1851. His family continues to own the mill until late in the 1800�s when it was sold to the Beaumonts.Transcript reads: ""GEORGE the THIRD by the Grace of GOD, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.

1800,,,,,,,,1800'S - EARLY,Box:Carpenter's Tool,"John Swinton's tool box, which dates from the early 1800's, appears to have a dual purpose. On the one hand, this apparently plain, wooden chest, painted black with rope handles at each end, was used as a container for his tools. On the other hand, and perhaps more importantly, as one examines the interior, it becomes obvious that this man used the box as an example of his craftsmanship. The owner's name is painted on the front and its condition is ""fair - good"".The underside of the lid is made of mahogany-coloured wood, which is cleverly inlaid with a delicate diamond pattern. Inside the box, at the top, are two wooden trays lying lengthways along the back and along the front, with a space in the middle to provide access to several drawers. The aforementioned trays contain a series of drawers with white knobs and may be moved from front to back on metal channels attached to the interior of each end of the box. Underneath these top trays is another set of trays, again with drawers, and again one being in front and one at the back. Altogether, there are fourteen drawers in the back units, nine in the lower and five in the upper. As well, the top unit has a hinged lid to provide access to the top section. The front units have fifteen drawers, nine in the lower, four in the upper and two small drawers, which may be seen at the lower right when the bottom front unit is moved toward the back into the empty space.In the bottom of the box and in the centre cavity are several tools. These are as follows: two keyhole saws, one large-handled chisel device, one bow saw, two soldering irons, two squares, one axe, one wooden mallet, two two-handled shaving tools, one small claw hammer, one brass compass engraved with the date 1809 and the name, J. Robinson, one marking gauge, one large wooden plane and a set of ten routing planes, each with its own individual design for carving mouldings, cornices, etc. The large wooden plane and the set of routing planes are all hand-made, most likely by Swinton.All in all, this artefact and its contents demonstrate that John Swinton was a true craftsman.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/969104.jpg,,969.104,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/969104.jpg,,"Carpenter, Carpenter Tools",

1800,,,,1887,,,,1800-1887,"Print, Photographic","Andrew Kemp, the son of U.E. Loyalist parents, was born in Niagara in 1800.His father, David Kemp, was a native of New Jersey who arrived in Canada in 1793 and in 1796 married Rebecca Ransier. His wife�s people belonged to New York, and had suffered much at the hands of the Revolutionists. Rebecca herself owned a farm which was confiscated with other property of the family. The name of Ransier (properly speaking it is Rensselaer) can be seen on muster rolls ofButler�s Rangers, and also on the U.E. List, as that of a member of the celebratedcorps.David Kemp�s father and mother were from Scotland, they came fromAberdeen about the middle of the eighteenth century and settled in New Jersey.David (born in 1769) was the second of their three sons, and there were several girlsin the family besides David and his younger brother. While David and his brother were too young to bear arms in the Revolutionary struggle, their father and elder brother were active adherents of the loyalist side. At the Kemp�s home, friends of the cause were ever welcome, and in various ways they earned the hatred of their rebel neighbours. The youngest boy, who was a baby when General Burgoyne took command in Canada, was christened ""Burgoyne"" in honor of that officer, from whom the loyalists expected such greatachievements. When the child could just speak plainly he happened one day to bestanding in the road near his mother�s house, two men, evidently wayfarers,approached and one of them asked the little fellow his name, ""Burgoyne Kemp"" wasthe reply. The questioner turned to his companion with a laugh, ""I think"" said he ""thatwe are all right and need not inquire further,"" and then told the youngster to showthem where he lived. They proved to be British agents in search of information orrecruits, and being anxious to find a resting place among friends, they rightly took theboy�s name to be a sufficient guarantee for the loyalty of his people. But the Kemp�scallers were not all of this description; before the war was over the men of the familywere hunted like wild beasts, they lay for many days in a cave or hole of some sort inthe ground; one of them contracted rheumatism so badly during their hardships that hewas a cripple for the balance of his days. When the war ended they would gladlyhave remained in their home had they been allowed to live in peace, but after trying itfor a while they went to New York State, having lost nearly everything theypossessed. They continued in New York for a few years; but being Loyalists still, andat no pains to conceal their opinions their neighbors seem to have invoked the aid ofthe authorities, and a party was sent to apprehend the older male members of thefamily. Receiving a hint of the coming danger they went into hiding near their house,and the escort was completely deceived as to their whereabouts by the lad Burgoyne,who acted as spokesman on this occasion. Shortly afterwards the Kemps crossed overto Canada.David Kemp�s name (as well as those of his brothers) appears in the list ofsubscribers to the building fund of St. Andrew�s Church, Newark, 1794, and also asone of the earliest pew-holders. They had come to Niagara in 1793, he removed toAmherstburg early in the last century, and at about the commencement of the War of1812 was employed in the Engineer Department. He accompanied the troops toBrownstown, and when Proctor retreated from Amherstburg, was one of the last who quitted Fort Malden, as he stayed to superintend the dismantling of the fort anddestruction of stores. His family also accompanied the retreat. His eldest son,Andrew was then 13 years of age. The latter used to occasionally tell his grandsonsabout those times and one of the lads wrote down part of his grandfather�srecollections. They are giving here in the old gentleman�s own words:-""After General Hull�s demonstration against Fort Malden, which ended in hisretreat to Detroit and the surrender of that post to General Brock, I saw Brock atAmherstburg; he was a fine jolly looking, middle aged man. I also saw Tecumseh; hewas a handsome, noble looking fellow, very clean and neat about his person, andusually dressed in a white shirt, deer skin leggings and other usual Indian apparel, butsometimes in a military red-coat, for he ranked as a Major-General. I have spoken tohim. He was a Shawanee, who in common with many with many other WesternIndians had been at war with the Yankees, and came all the way to Canada to fight forthe British."" ""A battle on the lake took place about 25 or 30 miles from Amherstburg,where we heard the guns. The British ships were mostly small merchantman with agun on board, commanded by a captain of the Royal Navy as Commodore. He hadlost an arm at Trafalgar. The provincials were poor sailors compared to Britishseamen, being mostly French Canadians and some of the crews were only soldiers.The vessels were undermanned and there were not sufficient guns, and what gunsthere were not good while the American gunboats carried 32prs.""Referring to Proctor�s retreat during which (on the evening before the battle ofthe Thames the Kemps were taken prisoners, Mr. Kemp said:-We were taken prisoners a short distance above the village of Chatham whileascending the Thames. Father had been left behind at Chatham to destroy a vesselwhich was there, and only came up with our detachment a short time before we weretaken. It was very late when he reached us. He at once went ashore to reconnoiterfrom a hill nearby, from there he saw the Kentucky Rifle Militia coming across thefields on horseback. We intended to reach an old empty house on the other side of theriver and attempted to do so, but before we succeeded the bank was full of men whofired some shots at us because we did not come ashore fast enough when ordered, andthey shot a woman through the cheeks. When they got us ashore, they robbed us ofeverything they could carry away even my mother�s young baby�s clothes. Theychopped up everything else including a feather bed, and out blankets they put aroundtheir shoulders. Father was furious; he told them if there had been only half a dozenof them named Naggs, who knew us, and who had formerly lived in Detroit, had tobeg and pray of father to be quiet, fearing they would shoot him. Soon after theAmerica Regulars under General Harrison came up, and my father was placed under aregular guard when he at once complained of the treatment we had received. He wasadvised to complain to the General and so mother went and spoke to him. Harrisonwas very kind to her and said ""My good woman I will do everything I can for you.""But the Militia only said ""who cared for General Harrison? None of his business whatwe do.""""My father was taken to Petite Cote near Sandwich where he lived on parolefor a time (during the winter) until one day an officer came down and told him hisparole would be up on a certain day, and that he was to go to Detroit; when with otherprisoners he would be sent to Green bush. When he got to Detroit and had reportedhimself, he noticed that the Americans seemed very lax in the way they looked aftertheir prisoners, so he began walking about and getting farther and farther away, and atlast he slipped around a corner when he took to his heels and made his way to theback of the town, where he had plenty of friends who hid him, and helped him to get across the river again to the Canadian side. Father and I then set out on April 7th,1814, to join the British forces at Niagara. My mother went to some friends atSandwich. The first day out we had a canoe to travel in, the second day being on foot,we met a man named Johnson who was out looking for his horses, he had one horsewith him and this he allowed me to ride all day. When we reached Johnson�s house,we were obliged to stay there two days lying quiet, because we heard there of a partyof Americans who were near. After this we continued our journey on foot. On oneday our way lay through the �Long Bush� where the road was just a cart track and nohouse for twenty-seven miles. The walking was dreadful, the snow newly fallen beingabout a foot deep with almost another foot of mud underneath. I got so tired that Ilagged behind continually and father would have to wait for me, finally he made mewalk ahead of him. I felt very downhearted and miserable, and father kept trying tocheer me up. At last we heard a cowbell which raised my spirits a little, and aboutdark we got into the village of Delaware, where we had plenty to eat and were madecomfortable. Soon after that we had to go through the Township of Burford where thefarmers were a very disaffected lot. They were very suspicious and inquisitive as towhere we came from, and grumbled very much when we asked for a bed. They madeus shake down in front of the fire, which the hired man put out by sticking a large logon it, and there we lay and shivered all night on the floor which was made of roughlogs with large cracks between, while there was a hole under the door large enoughfor a hog to come in at.""""When we got to the Grand River the bridge was broken down, but we couldalmost wade it. Where Hamilton now stands there was only one house at that time; asmall stone cottage near the mountain."" ""We reached Niagara safely April 20th and went to a friend�s. When wearrived General Riall was down by the river, and sent up soon after to ask if there wasa man belonging to the Engineer Department come from Sandwich, father went out tohim, and was told he was wanted over at the Fort at once. General Riall asked him ifhe had brought his little boy with him and father said �Yes.� The General then askedif I was a mechanic and father told him �No� I had been at school. The General said�Well, that�s better for him, but bring him along and we�ll make him useful. I was puton regular rations of bread, meat and run, and my pay was fifteen dollars per month.We stayed here in good quarters till the end of the war. I used to sell my rum for twodollars a quart. All the men got two dills extra to work on. I have seen a hogshead knocked in the morning and all gone by dark. My work was to serve out tools andrum to the men. It was excellent rum, quite thick, it is very hard to get any rum like itnowadays. It was worth twenty-five cents a gill. Our work was done outside near theFort. There was a shanty here and father used sometimes to leave small sums ofmoney on a shelf there so as to be handy. It was always stolen when he did so, andsuspicion fell on a man of the 1st Royal Scots, so a watch was set on him. He was aGerman, there were two loose stones in the foundation of the hut so that it waspossible to get under the building. A hole was made in the floor and a watch set, andsure enough the man was caught and got 200 lashes.""""The Colonel of royal Scots in order to make his men hardy, used to makethem do sentry-go in the depth of the winter of 1814-1815 without their great coats.They had come to Canada from the West Indies.""""There was a British gun-boat destroyed a few miles from Niagara. She was atYork and her commander � a lieutenant was ordered to proceed to Niagara. On hisown responsibility he under took to give passage to some ladies who were going toBurlington and went in there to land them. The wind was then in his favour buttowards evening it changed, and he found himself beating up against it, trying to makethe mouth of the river, with two Yankee gun-boats rapidly getting the weather gaugeof him. The chase could be seen from Niagara, and the ramparts on the lakeside werelined with people watching the struggle. The Americans kept heading the Britisheroff, firing at him all the time and he replying to their shots. Finding it impossible togain the shelter of the shore batteries, the commander of the British vessel ran herashore in the mouth of a creek a few miles off and blew her up. It was then dusk andthe explosion and fire in the wreck could be plainly seen by the lookers on. TheBritish officer was court-martialled and the dismissed from the service. It was said heafterwards joined the American service.""""The village of Queenston changed very little from the time I was there in1815, up to when I visited it last a few years ago.""""There was a woman who lived in Amherstburg at the time of Proctor�s retreatwhen the Americans overran the place, who used to make plate pies out of sour greenapples to which she put no sugar, and made up the paste without a particle ofshortening in it. She sold the pies to the American soldiers at twenty-five cents each.""The family were united in Amherstburg after the close of the war. AndrewKemp was an ensign in the 1st Essex Militia in after years, and assisted in the captureof the Schooner �Anne� during the trouble of 1937-8. He also formed one of theexpedition to Pelee Island, March 3rd, 1938, from whence the regulars and militia aftera smart action drove the ""Patriot Army"" (otherwise ""Brigands,"" as they are describedon the old monument at Amherstburg.) Soon after the rebellion Andrew Kempentered the Engineer Department. David Kemp died in 1842, leaving a large numberof descendants. His son Andrew removed to Kingston in 1848, and retired from theDepartment in 1869, being then Clerk of Works. He died in 1887 in his 87th year.(The notes from the reminiscences of Andrew Kemp were taken by H.G.Goodfellow and the abrupt break is thus accounted for. When Mr. Kemp found thathis grandson was taking notes he stopped suddenly and would talk no more. Thepatriotism of the family was again shown in the case of a grandson, R.W. Goodfellow,who went with the first contingent to South Africa and gave his life at Paardeberg,Feb. 18th, 1900. � J.C.)",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/054/9841307.jpg,,984.1.307,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/054/thumbs/9841307.jpg,,,

In his declining years George lived at ""Locust Grove"" in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The breeches were fashioned from camel coloured wool felt and feature pewter and brass buttons on the legs and cuffs. The breeches also have a brown triangular shaped piece on the back of the waistband. Though the colour is faded, more protected areas reveal the original rich hue. Wear marks on the breeches are absent. There is also a fall front of 8"" wide, 2 suspender buttons on the front and back, buttons and buttonholes at the knee and a buttonhole for a knee buckle. The 1810's style breeches were more fitted and the length extended to the knee where stockings or high boots covered the lower leg. Metal buttons fastened the drop front and would have held suspenders. Large pockets on either side appear to have a wing detail because of a two inch extension of the pocket above its outside seam. One small pocket on the front right side presumably housed a watch. Buttons are reinforced and the inner waist band measuring 34""is lined with linen. The shorter jacket front of this period dictated a higher waistline and drop front to cover the fly. Approaching 1820, fashion changed in favour of full length pants.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/9721791.jpg,,972.179.1,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/thumbs/9721791.jpg,,,

1795,,,,1830,,,,1795 C. - 1830,Uniform:Coat,"This is a wool and velvet coat that is believed to be designed for a Glengarry Militia Officer, but the date of origin is unknown. It is a single breasted green coat with a velvet trimmed stand up collar and cuffs. There are also three rows of buttons down the front. Decorative lace on the face and cuffs has been removed and the wings are missing from the shoulder. Theory states that this jacket belonged to Ensign Donald McDougald who served in the militia unit on the Niagara frontier during the War of 1812 (987.5.464). He was also in the 2nd Regiment of the Glengarry Militia as a Lieutenant as of September 1st 1839. This might mean that the tunic was his during the later stages of his service to the Militia. The coat could possibly be from 1812, however the buttons put it at a later date. The curved ""heart shaped"" pattern of the buttons on each side of the breast is different from the 1812-1815 straight pattern. Little is known of Glengarry Militia Coatees and Glengarry Light Infantry (GLIF) Uniforms. At first, this coat was documented as a GLIF uniform, but current research dispells that, however, continued research is required on this uncommon artefact. It is possible that components of the uniform are from the War of 1812 as well, as many Militia coats were used well after the War of 1812 by soldiers as the continued in their Militia service, being changed and modified to reflect the changes to new uniforms.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/972910-7.jpg,,972.91,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/thumbs/972910-7.jpg,,,

1793,,,,1842,,,,1793-1842,Book:Minute,"This interesting artefact records the actions of the civic leaders of the fledgling community of Newark from 1793 to 1842. The first meeting was held on August 17, 1793 by virtue of an Act of the Legislature of Upper Canada. Constable William Mollynox presided and Ralfe Clench (later Colonel of the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812) was the clerk.At this, and subsequent meetings, the town officers were appointed: clerk, assessors, collectors, town and church wardens, pound keepers, fence viewers and overseers of highways. The meetings were held yearly, in March, and were presided over by the constable. The bylaws passed at the first meeting, and reaffirmed at the following meetings, were few: ""Hogs cannot be allowed to run at large"" or ""the height of fences should be five feet to be lawful.""

In a household of great means the master or mistress would hold a key, as would a senior and trusted member of staff. The ceremony would begin with the caddy being opened to reveal a silver foil lined compartment or compartments and in some cases a crystal mixing bowl. This bowl was used to blend the exotic teas.

1780,,,,,,,,1780 C.,Waistcoat,"Ready-made clothing was scarce in Niagara in the late 1700s. While there was demand from the newly arrived loyalist settlers, there were few skilled tailors and clothes were expensive. An individual's wardrobe was limited and was manufactured with the intention that it would last for many years. Moreover, cloth was expensive and difficult to obtain in Upper Canada, nearly every yard had to be imported. This waistcoat was not designed for utility, setting it apart from the clothing worn by most of the early settlers in Niagara in the late 1700s. Adorned with false pockets, floral trim and steel beads, this silk waistcoat is clearly identifiable as the property of a wealthy individual. Robert Hamilton, the owner of this garment, was one of the most influential settlers in early Upper Canada. He began his business in 1780 in Queenston and made a fortune provisioning the British military and First Nations refugees from the United States. Supplying these groups required immense resources and Hamilton was quick to capitalize on the demand. He went on to build an extensive network of merchandising and land speculation which had a tremendous impact on the settlement pattern of Niagara, most of which he personally oversaw through his active involvement in local politics. Hamilton was criticized for using his position as Justice of the Peace, Judge of the Court of Common Peace and Member of the Land Board to advance his own business interests, all of which had a lasting impact on the community at Niagara. A merchant and politician, Hamilton was the main wholesaler of grain, held most of the settler's mortgages, supplied a majority of the goods and was the primary purchaser of the lands of the early settlers. This garment would have been worn as he served in his various court functions and is a fitting reminder of Robert Hamilton's patronage and power. Hamilton's legacy remains in Niagara in the settlement pattern, the roads, and personal artifacts such as this elegant waistcoat.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/97265.jpg,,972.65,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/thumbs/97265.jpg,,,

Franklin eventually sold his business to Hall, who brought William Sellers onboard. This four-shilling note was issued in 1773 by Hall and Sellers.You may notice that Pennsylvania is incorrectly spelled �Penfilvania�BUT this was purposeful. Franklin invented a way to prevent counterfeit bills. He would routinely spell Pennsylvania wrong in the hopes the forgers wouldn�t catch on. Another method Franklin invented to prevent forgeries was to have images on the notes which would be inimitable.

1770,,,,1780,,,,1770-1780,Clog,"This is an example of a patten or slipshod from the late 18th century. Pattens are a protective overshoe that were worn outdoors to keep the wearer elevated above the mud/dirt before urban paving was introduced. Pattens were popular right from the Middle Ages to the late-19th century. This patten shows a wooden sole with leather and velvet strap over the ankle; an iron ring attached to the bottom gives the patten the height it needed.This patten was featured in the book, ""100 Years, 100 Artefacts"" which has this to say, ""How many times have you heard the phrase ""She is a slipshod housekeeper"" or ""that work is slipshod""? I was intrigued to discover the derivation offered in Lorraine O'Byrne's (Former Curator of Black Creek Pioneer Village) booklet ""What is it?"" The picture showed a farm woman ""slippershod"", elevated some five centimetres on top of pattens: two oval iron rings separated by two struts under a thin wooden sole with leather straps tied over the instep. Her skirt and petticoats were lifted and the slippers saved from dirt or snow when she gardened or collected eggs from coop or root cellar. Upper class women with servants went out for walks outdoors. Neither beaded moccasins nor silk slippers stand up to the ground without pattens. Pattens are centuries old. Elizabeth Semmelhack (Curator Bata Shoe Museum) explained that the dating depends on the sole's toe shape: almond shaped in the 1760's to pointier towards 1800 and squarish from 1800-1850's. (This is) most likely from the 1770's or 1780's.Wooden shoes and clogs were universal. Colonial ""wedding shoes"" - leather sole, instep, and wooden 5-7cm heel covered with brocade- needed clogs to lift all off the dirt so the shoes could last for church and parties.As the horses needed ""shoes"" to prevent slipping, so the shoe makers needed blacksmiths to create pattens.

Peter Wall solved this issue with the creation of the ""Niagara Canning Company Limited"" in 1940. Shareholders in the company had the privilege of being the first in line to deliver fruit but also saw return on the profits. During the canning season women from the community, and even some travelling in from Mennonite communities out West, would work long hours in the cannery. A boarding house, which accommodated 60 people, was located nearby where the women would be picked up and dropped off daily.

There were no duplicates of any piece created. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. He dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston and located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr. Bruce Rigg's office and home on King Street.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/074/2004013002-4.jpg,,2004.013.002,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/074/thumbs/2004013002-4.jpg,,"R.J.R.

Fort George National Historic Park Restoration Plans.Prints of various elevation levels for Butler's Barrack 1 and Butler's Barrack 2.After turning over Fort Niagara to the Americans in 1796 Britian decided to build a fort on the west side of the river to protect their interests in Upper Canada. In 1802 construction of Fort George was complete. During the War of 1812 the fort was captured by the Americans and damaged when the Americans burned the town of Newark and retreated in 1813. Parts of the fort were rebuilt during and after the war. By the 1820's the fort was falling into ruin. It was abandoned in favour of Butler's Barracks and Fort Mississauga. The fort, and the area around the fort was part of the Department of National Defence. After 1867 the lands were used for periodic summer military camps to train militia for national defence, on the eve of the Great War the lands were turned into a military training camp. Begining in 1919 there was a national study taken by the Federal Government on the creation of National Historic Site preservation, but there was never anything done on any actual preservation. In 1934, due largely to depression era government work projects, the land and fort was leased to the Niagara Parks Commission for reconstruction of Fort George. By 1940 the reconstruction of the fort was complete. During World War Two the land was once again turned into a military training camp. After the war there were occasional military camps on the grounds, but these were stopped during the Cold War with a change in direction on military training due to nuclear weapons. In 1969 the site was transferred to Parks Canada and designated a National Historic Site of Canada. National Park surveys were a way for Parks Canada to inventory their National Historic Sites.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/9875022(a_b).jpg,,987.5.022(A&B),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/066/thumbs/9875022(a_b).jpg,,"Fort George, War of 1812Butlers Barracks, Fort Mississauga, National Historic Site",

John Breakenridge born in 1789 (d. 1828) was the son of an early United Empire Loyalist, David Breakenridge. The Breakenridge family initially settled just outside of Prescott. Here David was a local magistrate and Methodist Minister. His son, John was an established barrister with the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1812. He was a student at law and was called before the Upper Canada Kings Bench in 1817. John Breakenridge married Mary Warren Baldwin (the youngest sister of William Warren Baldwin of Spadina, Toronto, a lawyer and Treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada) in 1816. John Breakenridge died in April 1828. The Breakenridge-Hawley house house was the second house that he built and lived in from 1817 until 1824 when it was sold to Thomas Dickson.

It was moved here from its original site near present-day Balmoral Dr. (just off Mississauga St., south of Anne St.) It may have incorporated a part of the house which Col. Butler did occupy, which was on the same piece of land as this one. Col. Butler's house is marked on Andrew Gray's 1810 plan of the town near the 2-mile Creek - a cairn marks this spot today. This was outside the boundaries of the original town survey, and thus not one of the lots granted in the 1790s to loyalists.

Butler is an integral figure to the origins of Niagara, having brought together and commanded a group of loyalist soldiers from the Mohawk valley that played a large role in the American Revolution. The Rangers disbanded in 1784 to Fort Niagara, which had been used as their base. Butler moved across the river with a number of families soon after that to start a farming settlement to provide food for Fort Niagara.

1959,,,,,,,,5/12/1905,Drawing,"Soft pencil drawing of the McFarland House by J. G. Williams.John McFarland was born in Scotland and served in the British Navy in the colonies during the American Revolution. Upon retirement he was granted large tracts of land in Newark. The McFarland House was built on this land in 1800, an additional large back wing was added in 1875 for additional living space. The house was not burnt down during the War of 1812, so it is one of the few buildings in the area to pre-date the war. This Georgian Style building is located on the Niagara Parkway south of the East West Line. It is currently owned by the Niagara Parks Commision. It underwent extensive restoration in 1955 and opened to the public in 1959. Further renovations were completed in 2012. It is currently open for house tours and tea is offered in the newly added conservatory.John G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949.

There were no duplicates of any of the pieces. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg.

The main Western Home was demolisted around 1914. The cottage was used by the Polish Army during WWI while training at Niagara Camp. A long period of dereliction left only the cottage portion of the house remaining. The current owner has done extensive restoration which includes a new addition to the back of the original cottage.

Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949. The sketches in the collection of the Niagara Historical Museum we completed in the 1950's. John G. Williams died in 1960.This remarkable property�four heavily forested acres in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake---has passed intact through many hands since its origin as a crown grant to a veteran of Butler�s Rangers in 1796. The first private purchaser was Robert Pilkington, a military engineer in the intimate circle of John Graves Simcoe, who assigned Pilkington numerous commissions to erect fortifications and public buildings in Upper Canada. After only a year of ownership, Pilkington conveyed the property in 1799 to Ann Claus, in a most unusual transaction. Ann Claus was the daughter of the colonial magnate Sir William Johnson, the widow of Johnson�s chief assistant in the Indian Department, and the mother of William Claus who in 1796 succeeded John Butler as deputy Indian commissioner for the Six Nations reserve. According to the records, the purchase money was obtained by the sale of reserve land, the tribes then conveying the town property to Ann Claus in gratitude for her (deceased) husband�s ""many kindnesses"", a piece of business which could have been transacted only with the permission and guidance of her son William, the financial trustee of the Six Nations. William built the first house, but it was destroyed by the American army in 1813, when its root cellar provided winter refuge for the family of an officer at Fort George. The house was rebuilt, and William lived there until his death in 1826. He often received his Indian wards there, who camped by the banks of One-Mile-Creek, which flows through the property. The present house consists of considerable extensions upon the original 1816-17 construction, and is shielded from view by a forest which includes some extraordinarily tall and broad trees, some of them centuries old. Claus was a pioneering arborist, who planted the very tall stand of sycamores which line the property on its King Street boundary. He also introduced soft-fruit cultivation to Niagara, with an orchard of nectarines and peaches; today, only a single ancient pear tree survives from that orchard. Claus left diaries recording not only the progress of the building, but also the planting of flowers, trees, and vines in the extensive grounds In the 1850�s the property was sold to yet another family prominent in the pioneer annals of Niagara, the Dicksons. Walter H. Dickson was the only son of Niagara�s richest man, William Dickson, whose magnificent home was burned in 1813 when Walter was seven, and William was away in a prisoner of war camp. The family fortune began with trade, but grew mightily through land speculation throughout the province, and Walter lived as a lawyer and Conservative politician until his appointment to the first Canadian Senate, in 1867. After his death in 1885, the property passed out of his family. In 1919 the property, known as the Wilderness, was bought by W.R. Austin, whose daughter Mrs. Parker became owner in 1925.

The first factory to can fruit in Niagara was set up in St. Davids in 1897 in an old flour mill. This building burned down in 1923 and a new plant was erected in 1924. St. Davids was a good location for the factory due to the large peach farms located in the region and the local access to good roads and railroads in the St. Davids area.

1932,,,,,,,,4/15/1905,Print,"Coloured print of an original watercolour from 1871 (by J.D. Kelly) and includes a hand-written note identifying the figures in the painting. It depicts the opening of the first Parliament in Upper Canada by the British Parliament. Smart red-coated soldiers stand at attention as Lt. Governor John Graves Simcoe arrives riding a sleek black horse. The colours are autumnal and among the bright yellow trees are smartly dressed on-lookers, both officials and local citizens. On the reverse of the print is the text:""In 1791 a Bill known as The Constitutional Act was passed in the British Parliament, dividing distance of the western part of the colony from the seat of government at Quebec, and also that the French in Lower Canada might retain their own system of government, while for the English in Upper Canada might be created a system in harmony with their traditions.Colonel John Graves Simcoe, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and a man of wide experience, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. He arrived, at Quebec, in late autumn and spent the winter there.The induction of Governor Simcoe was celebrated at Kingston on the 18th of July 1792, amidst the most primitive surroundings, yet with military pomp and ceremony.His Executive Council was Formed of:Messrs.:William Osgood, Chief Justice,James Baby,Alexander Grant,Peter Russell, Receiver General,In addition to these wereRobert Hamilton,Richard Cartwright,John Munro,Members of the Legislative Council ,Among the Members of the Legislative Assembly, an Elective Body, were:Messrs.:John White - Attorney General,John Macdonell,E. W. Smith,David Burns, Clerk ol the CrownRichard Pollard, SheriffAlex Macdonell, Sheriff William Jarvis, Secretary of the Province.On the 21st of July, Governor Simcoe set out on a westward journey, establishing the Capital of the new Province at Newark, a small village at the mouth of the Niagara River, now known as Niagara-on-the-Lake. On the west bank of the picturesque Niagara, within sound, on a calm day, of the mighty cataract, was built the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, known as Navy Hall, and, within its log walls, the first Parliament of Upper Canada assembled on the 17th of September 1792. The artist has made a most artistic and interesting picture of Simcoe opening his little Parliament with all the dignity and ceremony at his command. No matter if the place of meeting was only a plain structure of wood, and the members of the House few in number, a new State had come into being; cannon roared in salute; the Lieutenant-Governor, mounted and in full military uniform, was received and escorted by a Guard of Honour from the Northumberland Fusiliers, elaborate in their striking military equipment. He entered the Chamber with stately bearing. The members of the House were summoned to his presence and he made his Speech from the Throne on the exact model of Westminster.The picture has been reconstructed from the best available records. A number of authentic portraits of historical personages, who took part, are shown in the picture.""",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/026/988262.jpg,,988.262,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/026/thumbs/988262.jpg,,"parliment, Upper Canada",

The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished. In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity. A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/9885521.jpg,,988.5.521,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/thumbs/9885521.jpg,,"Niagara-on-the-Lake, Queens Royal Hotel, Town Council, Tourism Water Bill",

The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930.

The Underwood had arrived.The Underwood typewriter was the first widely successful modern typewriter. It pulled together the three main design elements that would be found on all later machines, a four-row straight keyboard, front striking type-bars (giving visible typing) and one shift key. The Underwood was not the first to offer these essential features, the Daugherty was in 1893, but it was by far the best engineered machine to have done so by 1896.Franz Wagner, a brilliant engineer who was involved with the Caligraph and other pioneering typewriters, sold his invention to the John Underwood & Co., a major supplier of typewriter ribbons.

Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attened the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer. When the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion, CEF, which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and were sent to train at Niagara Camp on July 29 of the same year. The recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.When asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. ""I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare"" said the Colonel. ""My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winder owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time.""

1915,,,,,,,,3/29/1905,Handkerchief,"Designed by Fortunino Matania, this silk handkerchief was produced as part of the fundraising efforts for ""Italian Day"", which took place on October 7, 1915 in London, England. The event was organized by several Italian organizations in London eager to demonstrate their commitment to the Allied cause during the First World War. The illustration featured on this handkerchief is one of many pieces created during the war by Italian artist Fortunino Matania. Matanaia was born in 1881 to the respected Italian artist Eduardo Matania. Eduardo was employed as an artist in the publishing industry and his son seems to have learned from his father how to draw. Fortunino must have quickly picked up the family business quickly because the Italian publication ""L'Illustrazione"" began to receive submissions signed 'Fortunino Matania' when the boy was just 14 years old. Thinking at first that this was a prank being pulled by Eduardo's, the editors were astonished when the young boy arrived at their Milan office and demonstrated his incredible skills and they hired him on the spot.He continued to illustrate for various publishers and served for a time in the Army, becoming a highly capable war artist during World War one. His concern for artistic accuracy was meticulous to the point of eccentricity. He visited the front on several occasions, was provided with military equipment by the War Office, and built a replica trench in the garden of his home near London. This design, known as ""Pro Italia"", is one of 117 of Matania's pictures that were reproduced in London's ""The Sphere"" throughout the war. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1918 and in other major exhibitions in London and Italy. This handkerchief was purchased in support of the Italian Day ceremony by a Niagara-on-the-Lake family member who was serving in Europe and sent it home as a souvenir. The example is unique because it includes the original box it was packaged in. Lightweight souvenirs were ideal for shipping back home, and purchasing this special silk handkerchief also made a statement about one's commitment to the Allied cause during the War.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/029/2009004019(ac).jpg,,2009.004.019(A-C),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/029/thumbs/2009004019(ac).jpg,,"""Pro Italia"" Allies and Brothers-In-Arms for Justicehandkerchief Italy Britain Italian Day First World War, Great War",

CSL ceased its service and after a short stint with a new owner, the last voyage was in 1957. Low ticket sales and increased debt were responsible for the Cayuga's failure.

Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara. The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930.

It is decorated with flowers and leaves which are still largely intact after over 100 years. Created in 1912 by the Six Nations Council for the centennial of the death of Major-General Isaac Brock in The War of 1812, this wreath was used during the commemorative ceremonies at Brock's Monument in Queenston, Ontario. The Centennial offered the Chiefs of the Six Nations an opportunity to make public their ongoing grievances with the Canadian government. Using their undeniable contribution to the War of 1812, Six Nations Chiefs were actively involved with the ceremonies, making speeches and public appearances to emphasize their sacrifice and continued struggle to have their treaty rights respected.Chief William D. Loft was appointed to create the wreath and it was placed at the base of Brock's Monument at Queenston Heights on October 13, 1912. Inscribed on the surface is ""Six Nations 1812 -1912 - He Rests in Peace - Rodinosyonni"", along with an image of a black bear gripping a bundle of six arrows. During the ceremony, Chief De-ka-nen-ra-neh (A. G. Smith) gave a speech lamenting the lack of justice to the Six Nations in the historical record and expressed a desire to obtain representation in the Canadian House of Commons. The wreath is a poignant reminder of the marginalization of First Nations people and a bold assertion of their desire to be officially recognized by the Canadian government. By taking part in the ceremonies, the Six Nations were staking their claim as an integral and active force in the history and development of Canada.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/2004001001-8.jpg,,2004.001.001,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/thumbs/2004001001-8.jpg,,"War of 1812drum commemorationnative, First Nations, Aboriginals, Six Nations, Haudenosaunee",

In 1912, he emigrated to the United States, where he settled in New York and became a member of the Polish Falcons Alliance of America. He completed the Falcons' instructor course in Philadelphia, which was designed to create a corps of military instructors to train future officers for a Polish Army. Wiacek was part of the inaugural Polish Officers' School of Infantry class at the University of Toronto and upon completion, he graduated as a Lieutenant. Antoni was given a position at the Polish Army Recruitment office in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the summer of 1918, he joined the Firs Rifle Regiment of the Polish Army in France. In the spring of 1919, Wiacek was transferred to Poland to take part in the Polish-Soviet War, where he was put in command of his own company. In May of 1920, Antoni was shot in battle near Lipowca-Napodowski. Even though he was injured he carried on leading his company. Among the Regiment Officers, his actions were regarded with the highest honour. He would go on to repeat these actions again in battle near Rowne, where he was seriously wounded. After being discharged from the army, he was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari, Croix de Guerre and the Cross of Valour (three times). After the war, Wiacek stayed in Poland to help his country regain its independence.

1911,,,,,,,,3/25/1905,Print:Photographic,"This is an Owen Staples sketch made of the Butler House, 275 Simcoe Street, made 1911. This house was never occupied by Col. John Butler, who died in 1796, but does have a historical connection to his family. It was moved here from its original site near present-day Balmoral Dr. (just off Mississauga St., south of Anne St.) It may have incorporated a part of the house which Col. Butler did occupy, which was on the same piece of land as this one. Col. Butler's house is marked on Andrew Gray's 1810 plan of the town near the 2-mile Creek - a cairn marks this spot today. This was outside the boundaries of the original town survey, and thus not one of the lots granted in the 1790s to loyalists. It was certainly one of the first surviving houses constructed in Niagara, but its origins are of some dispute. Most histories attribute the building of the house to James Butler, the brother of Col. John Butler. Col. Butler is an integral figure to the origins of Niagara, having brought together and commanded a group of loyalist soldiers from the Mohawk valley that played a large role in the American Revolution. The Rangers disbanded in 1784 to Fort Niagara, which had been used as their base. Butler moved across the river with a number of families soon after that to start a farming settlement to provide food for Fort Niagara. In 1796, after Fort Niagara was finally ceded to the Americans, the remainder of the Rangers and loyalists moved across, and many of these families and their children were granted land in the town of Niagara. Col. Butler, and much of his family, are buried in Butler's Burying Ground, at the end of Butler St.1815-1816 is generally thought to be the building date of the house, but there is some possibility the house was built prior to the War of 1812 and survived - it may have been overlooked by those burning the town in 1813 because of its location outside the town boundaries. Janet Carnochan's History of Niagara, states that it was called the ""James Butler House,"" and that ""reliable evidence shows that it was there on the day of the Battle of Queenston Heights."" There are also varying theories about the house's builder - it may have also been built by Ann Clement, the widow of Thomas Butler, Col. Butler's son. In the 1850s it was owned by another James Butler, the son of Thomas and Ann, who altered the front of the house in a Greek Revival style.In the latter half of the 20th century the house was restored and moved to its current location. The house used to have another wing, probably added by James Butler in the 1850s, to accommodate his family, which has since been removed. Owen Staples (1866-1949) was a Canadian painter, etcher, pastelist, political catroonist, author, musician and naturalist. He moved to Toronto in 1885 and began working for the Toronto Telegram as a staff artist, reporter and political cartoonist. He also did illustrations for the J.

The man that was going over the gorge just got as far as the middle of the tunnel and he stayed there for at least � an hr. They had to get a rope & throw it out to him & then he put a weight to it & let in to the river & slide down it to the boat.""The message in this postcard may have been talking about this event:Niagara Falls, New York - June 14th 1910The Great Houdin, a tight-wire performer, entertained a holiday crowd this afternoon at an international carnival here, but hardly in the manner he intended. He was on the programme for a trip across the Niagara Gorge on a quarter inch diameter cable, holding fast by his teeth. His wire was stretched 100 feet below the Upper Steel Arch Bridge, a point where it was intended his feat would be witnessed by a crowd of 80,000 assembled on the State Reservation, as well as in Queen Victoria Park.He mounted his wire and began sliding from the New York bank toward the Canadian shore. Houdin was waving the flags of both countries as he slid along the wire. A slope was planned for the wire, but the weight of his body quickly pulled the strand, making it too slack. Houdin had to stop at a point over the centre of the river approximately 1,100 feet from the American shore and still 600 feet away from completing his journey. For a few minutes the immense audience applauded his feat, but when he did not continue toward Canada It was apparent that he was in difficulties, which he indicated by waving flags. Awe-stricken, the crowds looked on while the man, diminutive in form, struggled to retain his hold on the small pulley from which he was suspended. Houdin grabbed the cable with both his hands and then crossed his legs over the wire and hung that way for 45 minutes until he could be rescued. Houdin was not more than 200 feet north of the Upper Steel Arch Bridge that had been closed to traffic sometime before his scheduled trip however there were several hundred people on the bridge watching as events unfoldedFiremen were called and responded with several hundred feet of rope. A loop was tied in the rope around the cable with about 300 feet on one side and several hundred feet on the other. One end was thrown over the bank and the foreman slid it along on the cable by walking along on the bridge. Houdin had shifted his position repeatedly and when the rope finally neared him, he almost lost his balance as he reached for it, so eager was he to accept the succor offered. When it was seen that he had grasped the rope, a cheer went up from the anxious crowd that could be heard above the roar of the great cataract. When it reached Houdin the rope was cast off from the bank and it dropped to the lower river where the steamer Maid of the Mist observing that something was amiss picked up the lower end. The little steamer struggled with the current, but kept well under Houdin, who safely lowered himself hand over hand to reach the boat, a distance of nearly 200 feet. Another great cheer arose when Houdin was hauled safely aboard and sank to the deck completely exhausted. Houdin's real name was Oscar Williams, a steeplejack from Niagara Falls, NewYork.Reference note from http://www.niagarafrontier.com/history_story.html",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/039/2009003009.jpg,,2009.003.009,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/039/thumbs/2009003009.jpg,,"Queenston Heights, Brock's Monument, Carriage",

Sent to ""Mr. Chas Creed, Steamer Zenith City, Detroit Mich., Marine Post"".Hotel Chautauqua/Strathcona, c. 1887Built on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement, a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants� quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair.

Some townspeople were not in support of this project either because the town could not afford it or because they felt they did not need one. Eventually, the project went forward and in 1891 the Town of Niagara's Municipal Waterworks Plant was built!The water plant, made of brick with a tall stack, was located along the shore of the Niagara River, just off Ricardo Street.

The Recognition Service includes: Song of the Day, class service first motto second motto and third motto, class song of 1888, recognition day hymn alumni song and evening prayer.The Chautauqua Hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake. It was representative of a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.Chautauqua Hotel was built in 1887 and destroyed by fire Aug 25th, 1909. The hotel was built on land originally called Crookston. It was later purchased by the Niagara Assembly for a religious and intellectual summer resort. The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned down in 1909.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/9895453.jpg,,989.5.453,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/070/thumbs/9895453.jpg,,"Niagara Assembly, Chautauqua",

1888,,,,,,,,3/2/1905,Print:Photographic,"A sepia photograph of the Queenston Town area, and the Niagara River dated 1888. The photo is taken from Queenston Heights looking north towards Lake Ontario. The road running through the centre of the photograph and the centre of the town heading north and south is the current Queenston Street. Parallel and to the right is Princess Street/ Front Street and further to the right is the Niagara River. Places of interest that still existing today are: Willowbank: Located centre left in the photo, visible are the distinctive large columns of the house facing towards the Niagara River. Built in the Greek Revival Style of local sandstone between 1832-1834 for Alexander Hamilton (1794-1839) the Sheriff of the Niagara District and fourth son of the powerful Upper Canadian businessman, Robert Hamilton. Owned by the Hamilton family until 1934. The architect was John Latshaw, responsible for many of the finer building designed in the Niagara area. It currently houses School of Restoration Arts, an independent educational institution which offers a three-year post-secondary diploma in building conservation skills and theory.Queenston Baptist Church/Queenston Library and Community Centre. In the centre of the photo between Queenston St. and Princess St. is the building and steeple of the Queenston Baptist Church. Built in the Gothic Revival Style between 1842-1845 with rough cut limestone. Load bearing walls 2 feet thick support the gable roof. Three gothic windows on the north and south side amd 2 windows in front. Closed as a church in 1918, sold to the Women's Institute in 1928, occupied and used by the Institute until 1954. It remained unoccupied and idle until it was purchased by a local resident in 1967, then donated in 1970 to the town of Niagara on the Lake. Renovated and opened in Dec 1972 as the Queenston Library and Community Centre. The building was restored at this time to it's 1928 appearance, minus the steeple. It is believed the wooden steeple in the front part of the building was removed when the Women's Institute made the necessary repairs and renovations when the building was purchased in 1928. Lightning and neglect made the structure beyond repair.St. Saviour Anglican Church. In the centre of the photo between Princess St. and the Niagara River is St. Saviour's Anglican Church, also known as Brock Memorial Church. Built 1877-1879 as a replica of a small church in England designed by Christopher Wren. Built of queenston limestone it has the same name as the church in General Brock's homeland of Guernsey, Channel Islands. A six sided steeple topped by a cross was added to the church some time after the photo was taken.South Landing Inn, also know in it's earlier days as Wadsworth House. Further south on Princess St. is a white building now known as South Landing Inn. Built in 1827 by Thomas Dickson, a prominant merchant, politician, and soldier. He fought with distinction in the War of 1812 as lieutenant-colonel in the 2nd Lincoln Militia. By 1883 the Wadsworth family owned and operated the building as an inn ""Frontier House."" In 1910, the building was sold and renamed Riverview Inn. The name was changed in 1947 to South Landing Inn. In 1953 Mrs. Rie Bannister, a weaver who had previously operated a weaving shop in Toronto, bought the building and changed the name to South Landing Craft Centre. The building was renovated in 1982 and is currently an Inn.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/050/991169.jpg,,991.169,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/050/thumbs/991169.jpg,,"Queenston, Willowbank, Queenston Baptist Church, Queenston Library and Community Centre, St. Saviour Anglican Church, Brock Memorial Church, South Landing Inn, Wadsworth House, Frontier House, Riverview Inn",

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants� quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/086/986088-2.jpg,,986.088,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/086/thumbs/986088-2.jpg,,"Hotel Chautauqua, Strathcona, Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movementamphitheatre, Michigan Central Railwaycottagesfire, Niagara Syndicate, Ryerson Park",
1886,,,,,,,,2/28/1905,Print:Photographic,"Photograph of the unveiling of the Joseph Brant Memorial in Brantford on October 13, 1886. Attendees listed on back but some are illegible. Some legible names include John Beverly Robinson (Lieutenant Governor at the time) and wife, General Middleton and wife, Supt. Gilkison, Mrs. Stratford, Hardy, Cleghorn, Indians.This is number 720 in the Society's 1911 Catalogue, Niagara Historical Society Publication #24. The following is from the United Empire Loyalists Association website (http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Brant-Joseph.php). The Joseph Brant Memorial cost $16,000 and was unveiled in Victoria Square October 13 , 1886 by the Hon. John Beverly Robinson , Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. The cornerstone was laid earlier on August 11, 1886, by Chief Ka-non-kwe-yo-teh.Victoria Square in Brantford, designed by the British born architect John Turner, is laid out in the plan of the Union Jack Flag with four diagonal paths intersecting at the centre where the Joseph Brant Memorial was unveiled in 1886 at a cost of $16,000.The memorial consists of a colossal statue of Brant, nine feet in height, two groups of three life sized figures each, and two trophies flanking the sides of the upper base, and four bassi-relievi upon the lower base, which terminates in a step upon the ground line.The pedestal is of gray granite, quarried near Penryn, Cornwall, England and weighs slightly les than fifty tons. The stone is of the very finest quality and chosen with regard to a coarse grain.The right � hand group as one faces the memorial shows chiefs of the Mohawk, Tuscarora, and Oneida Nations, furnished with the scalping knife, spear, and pipe of peace. The left-hand group shows the Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga Natives, with the bow and arrows, war-club, and flintlock gun. The trophies consist of artistic arrangements of their weapons and instruments, including snowshoes and lacrosse sticks. The totems of the Six Nations, the bear, the wolf and the tortoise, are introduced in the memorial, especially at the request of the Indians themselves.On the front of the lower base is a bas-relief, showing about 15 Indians engaged in a war dance. At the back another relief shows Brant addressing the chiefs in council.Two circular reliefs at the sides are devoted to the bear, with winter Canadian scenery, pines, etc., and the owl with maple tree foliage etc.The trophy at the back of the memorial exhibits the designations of the six tribes or nations and upon the trophy in front is inscribed in bold characters the single word ""Thayendanegea"".Her Majesty�s Government recognized the importance of the work by granting 13 bronze cannon weighing about 600 pounds each, to be melted and used in the casting of several statues. Some of these guns were over a hundred years old, formerly cast at Woolwich and a number of them were in use during the Crimean War.The sculptor, Percy Wood of London, England, received his education at University College, London, England, and studied medicine for some little time. The knowledge of anatomy thus acquired has doubtless proved serviceable in the profession which he subsequently adopted.The inscription at the memorial reads:This national monument erected by the Brant Memorial Association, incorporated 41 Vic. Cap. 62 S.O. toTHAYENDANEGEACapt. Joseph Brant, born 1742, died 1807, interred at the Mohawk Church and to the Six Nations Indians for their long and faithful services on behalf of the British Crown and their strict observance to treaties.Contributed to by the Six Nations Indians, the Chippewas, the Dominion of Canada, Province of Ontario,the City of Brantford, the Counties of Brant and Bruce, and private subscriptions.The British Government presented bronze cannons for the statues.Patrons: H.R.H.

Robinson, Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario.Joseph Brant (1741-1807) was born on the banks of the Ohio River. Brant�s first appearance as a warrior was at the Battle of Lake George, where the Six Nations, under their chief, Hendrick, and Sir William Johnson in command of the colonial troops, repulsed a formidable advance of French troops composed of the old veteran regiments of France. At this engagement, which was most severe, a young Indian made himself conspicuous in the fight, so much so, that after the battle was over, his brave conduct was reported to Sir William Johnson, who sent for him.He found him to be a tall young Indian named Brant, very intelligent but uneducated, being at the time only 14 years of age. Sir William Johnson determined to have him educated, and for that purpose placed him under the instruction of Dr. Wheelock, where Brant remained until he had secured a good English education.After finishing his studies, he devoted his whole time to the welfare of his people, translating the Gospel of St. Mark and the Common Book of Prayer into the Mohawk language for their benefit and doing every thing. He could do to promote civilizing influences among them. During the American Revolutionary War, Brant and the Six Nation Indians refused all temptations and remained true and loyal to their treaties with the crown.While his role as the warrior was his most native characteristic, he was outstanding as Indian adviser and mentor of his people, Indian affairs agent, diplomat to the British and American governments on their behalf, captain in the British Army during the American Revolution War, a biblical and liturgical translator, and builder of Anglican churches. When he died, he was buried at his home in Burlington but was re-interred beside Mohawk Chapel in Brantford in 1850. Brantford and the County of Brant are both named after him.Joseph Brant encouraged Loyalist settlement. He sold or leased land to settlers and the revenue was invested to provide an income for the Six Nations.Material was adapted from The Daily Expositor, Brantford, Ontario, Wednesday October 13, 1886 and the Brant Historical Society�s Walking Tour of Victoria Square.

It is a detailed record of the expedition led by Colonel Barry St. Leger from Montreal, along the St. Lawrence River, across Lake Ontario and through the Mohawk Valley, where the advance was halted by Fort Stanwix and the Battle of Oriskany before the army could reach Albany. This expedition was made up of British troops, the Kings Royal Regiment of New York under Sir John Johnson, Canadians, German troops, Butler's Rangers, Indian Department officers, and Indian Allies.It was one element of a larger campaign that was planned and led by Brigadier-General John Burgoyne which was intended to sever communications between the northern and southern colonies making it easier for the British to subdue the rebel colonists.The other two elements of the campaign called for Burgoyne's main army to advance southward from Canada following the Lake Champlain-Lake George waterway to reach Albany.The third element of the plan was for Sir William Howe to march north from New York along the Hudson River to prevent American forces from attacking Burgoyne's army from the south.The grand plan failed for several different reasons, one being the failure of Colonel St. Leger's forces to capture Fort Stanwix and his subsequent retreat. While the siege of Fort Stanwix was in progress, St. Leger received word that an American column was approaching from the west under Colonel Nicholas Herchmer, commander of the Tryon County militia. St. Leger immediately sent Loyalist soldiers and 400 Indians under Joseph Brant to ambush Herchmer's column. On 6 August 1777, the ambush was sprung as the column was passing through a gully and the ensuing battle of Oriskany was one of the bloodiest small engagements of the war. The Americans were dispersed and the Loyalist Provincials and Indians won the day, but because of the casualties suffered by the Indians, and the loss of supplies when a detachment of Americans raided their camp, together with St. Leger's failure to capture the fort, the Indians lost patience and left the field forcing the whole expedition to retreat to Oswego and finally to Montreal. Among the documents that were captured when the camp was overrun was Sir John Johnson's Orderly Book, and it has remained in American hands to this day. Meanwhile, Burgoyne's main army on the Hudson suffered huge losses and eventually was forced to surrender at Saratoga on 17 October 1777. Burgoyne's surrender later proved to be the turning point in the war.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/068/9854243.jpg,,985.4.243,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/068/thumbs/9854243.jpg,,"Oriskany Campaign Oswego Falls, Battle of Oriskany, Indian Department, Butler's Rangers Native Allies, Loyalists",

1870,,,,,,,,2/12/1905,Medal,"After the Civil War, a body of Irish-American veterans sought to obtain Irish independence from Great Britain, and believed that by capturing Canada, they could achieve this. Known as the Fenian Brotherhood, these radicals conducted raids into Canadian territory from 1866 to 1871 and although they had initial success, it would prove short lived. The movement ended in failure and was over by 1871. The only Fenian victory was the initial assault at Ridgeway in 1866, all subsequent actions were failures. Large bodies of British troops and Canadian militia defended the Canadian border and stopped the Fenians before they could gain a foothold in Canada.John Raynor of Niagara-on-the-Lake was one of the many Canadian veterans who were awarded this medal for service in 1870. Raynor had initially volunteered under the 1854 Canadian Militia Act and served in the army after the Trent Affair, when an American vessel captured Confederate diplomats from a British mail packet, creating severe tension between Britain and America during the Civil War. The Trent Affair encouraged Britain to increase the military presence in Canadian territory. Raynor's service throughout all of these incidents reflects a great deal of Canada's experience in the mid- 19th Century. It also illuminates the Canadian involvement in the American Civil War. The medal is a testament to Raynor's long service in the defense of Canadian territory.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/028/993542147.jpg,,993.542.147,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/028/thumbs/993542147.jpg,,"Fenian Raids, Military, Medal",

1868,,,,,,,,2/10/1905,Print:Photographic,"Photograph of Mary Elizabeth Olivia Josephine Servos (1859-1942) age 9. She was one of 5 children of Peter Claus Servos(1822-1877) and Mary Servos (Ball) (1827-1905).The story of the Servos Family in Niagara can be told through the history of the original homestead off Lakeshore Road. The property was previously owned by:Daniel Servos, until 1803John D Servos, until 1847Peter C Servos, until 1879Mary Servos, until 1905Mary Elizabeth Servos (photograph), until 1942Farm house burned to the ground in 1952.The Servos family emigrated to America in 1726 from Germany. They prospered in America and remained loyal to the British during the American Revolution. Because of their loyalty they lost all their possessions and had to start anew in Upper Canada as did other United Empire Loyalists. Daniel Servos, a Butler's Ranger, built the family homestead (also one of the first houses in the Peninsula) in 1783 at the junction of Four Mile Creek and the Lakeshore Road. On the property (known locally as Palatine Hill) he also built a grist mill and tannery, and operated a Trading Post for the early settlers. Daniel's oldest son was Captain John Dease Servos (1784-1847) who owned and ran the mills and farmed the property until his death. His son Peter Claus Servos (1822-1887) operated the farm upon his fathers death. In 1859 Peter was appointed Justice of the Peace. Due to financial and marital problems, Peter Servos and Mary Servos separated in 1879 and the Servos property on Palatine Hill was transferred to Mary Servos. Mary continued to operate the farm until her death in 1905, when it was divided between two of her daughters Mary Elizabeth Servos (photograph) and Margaret Marilla Aikins. The mill and homestead property remained with Mary Elizabeth. She continued to work the farm using 3rd party farmers. In 1921 she married Samuel Snider. In the 1930's back taxes plagued the property. Efforts were made to transfer the property to the government for maintenance as a historic property. These efforts failed. In 1940 portions of the property were sold to pay the back taxes and allow Mary Elizabeth Snider to live on the property until her death in 1942 at the age of 83. Subsequently portions of the property was again sold to pay off debts. Near the end the house was used to store hay for a farmer. On Oct 31, 1952 the house was burned to the ground as a Halloween prank.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/058/991374-2.jpg,,991.374,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/058/thumbs/991374-2.jpg,,"Palatine Hill, Servos Family",

The introduction of the jacquard loom in the early 1800s revolutionized weaving by simplifying the production of complex patterns by using punched or cut cards that guided the weaving process. The first use of a jacquard loom in Canada was in 1834, by Wilhelm Armbrust at his shop near Jordan, Ontario. He, like other early weavers, prepared his own patterns and cut the cards for his loom. Due to the complexity of jacquard woven coverlets, the profession became male dominated.

This was the first operational railroad in Upper Canada, and it ran (before it was completed) between Chippawa and Niagara Falls in 1838 and was likely operational into Queenston in 1839. In 1854, the rail line was taken over by Samuel Zimmerman and this is when the horse drawn operation ended and the rail cards were replaced with steam engines. The railway was also extended to Niagara (Niagara-on-the-Lake) bypassing Queenston. Following the death of Zimmerman in 1857 the Erie & Ontario underwent a few changes, including its purchase in 1863. It would be now known as the Erie and Niagara Railway, and in 1878 the Michigan Central Railroad assumed its operation in 1894 and then the New York Central Railroad in 1929.

This was done so by the Bank of Montreal until 1848. When the Rebellion Losses Bill passed in 1849, there was rioting in Montreal. This led to the destruction of the legislative buildings and the capital of the province was moved to Toronto. As a result the Bank of Upper Canada now produced the tokens.Between 1850 and 1857 the Bank of Upper Canada issued a series of penny and halfpenny copper tokens. The obverse of this half-penny token, issued in 1850, features a St. George and the dragon motif encircled by the legend BANK OF UPPER CANADA and the date, 1850.

1849,,,,,,,,1/22/1905,"Register:Births,Deaths","This document is a record made by Reverend Francis Lacey/Lacy of the births and deaths for the Baptist Church in 1849. It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855. Sometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a ""coloured"" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the ""Negro Burial Ground"". Unfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births listed in 1849 are: ""George Hunter (?), daughter; January 22, 1849-Mary Matilda ""Mr. Samuel Graham of a son. Born Aug 18, 1849-William Henry ""Jack (?) Washington of a daughter.

This included manners, sewing, painting, music and comportment. Samplers are therefore the most tangible evidence of female education during the early years of Niagara history. This charming traditional sampler is the work of Susan Chubbuck. The Chubbucks were well-known early merchants in Niagara.

This pedagogic volume, which was designed for use as a school text book, is a somewhat uneven blend of practical instruction for the ""scientific farmer"" which is sprinkled throughout with didactic poetry (""My Cottage Home,"" ""The Farmers' Fair"") and fables. It contains eight chapters filled with practical advice on husbandry and the most up-to-date theories on agricultural production. The first chapter, in the tradition of farming manuals, is a monthly gardener's calendar with ""Brief Hints."" The second chapter deals with ploughing, followed by a chapter on the production of assorted grains, vegetables and root crops. Subsequent chapters form short treatises on animal husbandry, butter and cheese production, new advances in farm mechanization, manure and composting, crop rotation, weed control, and the chemical benefits to be derived from the use of agricultural lime. Not surprisingly, this book does not discuss tender fruit production which, by the 1840s, was not yet economically widespread in the Niagara Peninsula. A second anomaly is the fact that none of the contributors to this volume were from Niagara, but rather were a mixture of the best British and American authorities. The compiler or editor of this text was the Reverend Thomas Brock Fuller (1810-1884). This volume was donated to the museum by Mrs. Thomas Elliot in May 1896.

Lilies usually represent innocence, especially the return to innocence when someone dies. The border features shrubs or flowering bushes, and the birds, often referred to as crows, are thistle finch, and are frequently found in Mennonite work. While very little is known about Isabella's life, we do know that she married James Durham (1805-1881) in December 1831 and they lived in the family home along the River Road in Queenston.

By far the most popular and beloved coverlet pattern was known as Four Roses, which is the pattern on this coverlet. This coverlet was woven for Maria Jane Durham (1834-1865) and she was that daughter of Isabella (nee McClive) and James Durham.

It depicts two hands shaking at the top centre above the date 1836, followed by the words ""Niagara District Mutual Fire Insurance Co."" The plaque is made of iron and is faded green, yellow, brown and black in colour.Open fires were an essential part of living in those days, used for heating in winter and cooking throughout the year. But with many fires often unprotected and unguarded, and many houses made almost entirely of wood, serious fires were quite common and often devastating. The intention was that the homeowner displayed the plaque on the outside of his house so that fire fighters, arriving to extinguish the fire, would see the plaque and know that they would be paid by the insurance company upon successful completion of their job. It is said that fire brigades would sometimes refuse to put out a fire if there was no immediate evidence of fire insurance on the property.Indeed, fire was so ever-present and potentially catastrophic at that time that it became common for many insurance companies to own and operate their own fire brigades until that responsibility was passed over to local government in 1866. In Niagara-on-the-Lake there is one known fire insurance plaque on a house dating from those times. It is at The Whale Inn, adjacent to the Niagara river at the junction of King and Delater streets.

1834,,,,,,,,1/7/1905,Sampler,"Fragile and ephemeral, cross-stitch samplers are among the few surviving artefacts of the domestic lives of young girls and women of the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries. As tangible evidence of their daily work, samplers offer a rare glimpse into the concerns and pursuits of our feminine ancestors. Unfortunately, their fragility and sensitivity to light also means they are seldom on display. The Niagara Historical Society has exhibited the samplers from its collection only three times in the past two decades.This charming and well-balanced sampler, completed by Augusta Stewart at Niagara in March 1834, is one of 29 samplers in the Niagara Historical Society's permanent collection. It is stitched entirely in cross and Algerian eye stitches; its colours of muted green, tan and gold silk are most likely faded from their original, more vivid hues. Bounded with a regular green and gold border, it features three alphabets, two sets of numerals and ten decorative horizontal bands - some stitched over two threads of linen and some over one. There are two spot motifs: a fruit basket (symbol of fertility) and two evergreen trees (symbols of life). It is damaged in five places.Little is known about Augusta Stewart - her age, her family, whether she remained in Niagara or whether she had any descendants.The most charming thing about her sampler is the inclusion of two opening verses of the Isaac Watts poem praising the industriousness of bees.

William Lyon Mackenzie had just moved from Dundas, Ontario to Queenston in 1824, where he was operating a general store and publishing his controversial newspaper, The Colonial Advocate. The printing press used to print this handbill, was likely the same press he used to print the newspaper that called for constitutional reform and inspired those to rise up against the Family Compact.In addition to Brock's numerous accomplishments, some of which are listed on this handbill, he has had the distinction of being buried four times. After his death on October 13, 1812, during the Battle of Queenston Heights, he was buried at his first resting place at one of the bastions at Fort George. But it was decided the ""hero"" of Upper Canada deserved a more suitable memorial, and in 1824, he, along with his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell, were buried beneath the monument in October of 1824. The vault beneath the monument was not going to be his final resting place.On April 17, 1840, the monument was damaged by a gunpowder bomb. It is believed that Irish-Canadian, Benjamin Lett, who was involved in William Lyon Mackenzie's 1837 Rebellion, was the culprit. The remains of Brock were moved to the Hamilton family cemetery on the grounds of Willowbank in Queenston, until they could reinterred under a new monument on October 13, 1853.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/9885158-6.jpg,,988.5.158,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/thumbs/9885158-6.jpg,,,

1819,,,,,,,,12/23/1904,Pamphlet,"The American Cookery is a cook book published by John Holbrook, in Brattleborough, in 1819. It is approximately 48 pages of recipes on how to prepare food ranging from meat to biscuits to jellies. It is possible that this is a later edition of Amelia Simmons. American Cookery. Hartford: Hudson & Goodwin, 1796. American Cookery was the first printed cookbook written by an American, and the first cookery title in which the word ""American"" appears. Amelia Simmons was known to describe herself as ""an American Orphan"". This publication is addressed specifically to orphans and others of ""unfortunate circumstances"" who ""are reduced to the necessity of going into families in the line of domestics."" While borrowing a few recipes from English works, most of American Cookery was an original compilation; thoroughly American in spirit and couched in the language Simmons's compatriots could understand. In its pages appeared the first recipes using corn meal as the basic ingredient, as well as earthy and vernacular directions for brewing spruce beer and soft American gingerbread. Molasses took the place of the European treacle, and Indian slapjacks replaced the Scottish griddlecakes. For the first time recipes appeared for wild turkey roasts, pumpkin pies, cranberry sauce, and watermelon-rind chutney. At the same time, some favored European ingredients were shunned: ""Garlicks, tho' used by the French, are better adapted to the uses of medicine than cookery."" Within months of its appearance, the original edition was heavily oversubscribed.

Brock was killed on 13 October 1812 during an attack by invading U.S. forces at Queenston Heights on the Niagara frontier. During the war, private tokens began circulating in great quantity in British North America due to a severe currency shortage caused by increased commercial activity, and to an initial distrust of the series of paper notes known as ""army bills'' issued by Brock.

The sketch was donated to the museum by Mary Ann Guillen, Mr. Riley's daughter, who was Janet Carnochan's major source of information about the town's 19th century black community. The drawing was done for Mrs. Guillen by a female acquaintance, shortly before the squared timber building was pulled down in the 1880's. William Riley, an escaped slave from Fredericksburg, Virginia, bought the one acre town lot, 276, at the corner of Mary and Victoria streets, from William Dickson for �50 in 1819, becoming the third black man to own property in the village. The price was fair for land in the area. However, one does wonder why Mr. Dickson paid only five shillings for it a short time earlier. Neither transaction was registered until 1886. Mr. Riley built the house in 1819, a year after his marriage at Lake Lodge (the home of Rev. Robert Addison), to Rev. Addison's German servant Fanny. By 1851, eight family members lived in the house: William, Fanny (a. 57), their children Mary Ann (27), Fanny (20), Edward (18) and three grandchildren, William (11), Fanny (3) and Edward (1). After Riley's death in 1860, Edward and his sisters inherited lot 276. The last family member to own the land was William's granddaughter, Fanny Rowley, who also owned 177 King and 143 King Street, and the Rowley Block on Queen Street. She left town in 1905, ending the family's connection with lot 276.

1812,,,,,,,,12/16/1904,Coin,"Nowhere in British North America did the private copper tokens issued by merchants and others have a more fascinating evolutionary history than in Lower Canada - now Quebec. In the 1820s and 1830s, trade in Montreal, the colony's commercial centre, created a strong demand for coinage. As coins were often in short supply, privately produced tokens filled the void. Tokens were not legal tender and their circulation was against the law. However, this was little deterrent at a time when legal coins were scarce. The first private coppers were heavy pieces, about the same weight as the penny and halfpenny coins they supplemented.However, by the 1830s the tokens were barely half the weight of the official coins and, at times, were so numerous that people would no longer accept them. Various tricks were therefore resorted to in order to make their circulation possible. One interesting approach was to copy the designs of tokens that had previously been of heavy weight and had enjoyed wide circulation. About 1832 a Montreal grocer named Tiffin issued copper halfpenny tokens. They bore the date 1812 and were imitations of much heavier pieces produced twenty years earlier. The obverse carried a bust of King George III surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves and acorns and the figure of a seated woman representing Commerce was the design on the reverse. It is unknown at this time if this is an original token or one created by Tiffin in Lower Canada.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/025/970931.jpg,,970.931,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/025/thumbs/970931.jpg,,,

1812,,,,,,,,12/16/1904,Sabre,"This is an American regulation issue cavalry sabre that has a ""US"" inscription on one side of the curved blade and an ""N. Ward"" inscription on the other. The sword is made of forged steel and features a leather covered handle. It was reported to have been taken from an American Officer and delivered to General Murray of the 100th regiment, during the capture of Fort Niagara on December 19, 1813. Following the retreat of American forces from Niagara and the subsequent burning of the town, the British wasted no time reoccupying the ruins of Fort George and planning an assault on Fort Niagara. More than five hundred soldiers crossed the Niagara River to Five Mile Meadows on the night of December 19, 1813 and silently turned north toward Youngstown. American pickets stationed in the village were taken by surprise, and the attackers obtained the garrison password. A short march carried them to Fort Niagara where they burst through a partially open gate and caught the garrison unprepared. With Fort Niagara secured, the British and their Indian allies marched back upriver, destroying farms and villages on the New York side as far as Manchester (present day Niagara Falls). A second British raid at the end of December burned Buffalo and completed the devastation of the Niagara Frontier. Only the buildings of Fort Niagara were left intact to shelter a British garrison. An officer indicated surrender by offering his sword to his conqueror. The sword, then, became the symbol of the victory and was surpassed only by an enemy's flag or ""colours"" and by his artillery pieces as trophies of war. In the 1911 ""Catalogue of Articles in Memorial Hall"" there is a listing for item 188, ""sword delivered to Gen. Murray at the capture of Fort Niagara, Dec. 19, 1813 and by him handed to Lieut. D.K. Servos; has been in the possession of the family ever since."" The item was donated by A.D.K. Servos of Niagara Township sometime after 1896.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/010/971152-8.jpg,,971.152,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/010/thumbs/971152-8.jpg,,,
1812,,,,,,,,12/16/1904,Wallet,"Made of brown leather, this typical early 19th century wallet has a tongue flap to close the wallet and opens flat for access to the two compartments. Brown pebble finish leather, inside pockets and lining of softer brown leather, with decorative tooled edge of linked triangles.It was May 26th, 1813; the wife of Captain Martin McClellan of the 1st Lincoln Militia left the family farm on John Street and found safety three miles away. This artefact was donated by the family of Martin McClellan and the following is a description of the course of events by the family. Martin McClellan visited her in Virgil and provided his wife with his watch and this pocketbook. He told his wife that he would never see her or their children again. For 5 days, McClellan could see what the rest of the British garrison in Niagara could see. Across the Niagara River, thousands of American troops on parade around Fort Niagara, workers preparing batteries and boats and 17 armed vessels returning triumphantly from the burning of York. McClellan and the small garrison in Niagara would be no match.As fog lifted at daybreak the following day, McClellan would see 16 ships, 134 boats and scows (each with 30 - 50 American soldiers) two miles from the Town of Niagara. By 9 o'clock, some 2,300 American soldiers started the land assault under the cover of heavy artillery. The British defence was approximately 567 men, both regulars and militia. It took several attempts for the Americans to assemble on a plain at the western end of the town. McClellan was in line with the rest of his company facing the U.S. forces a mere 5 - 10 meters away. The two sides fought for over 15 minutes. In the end, the British were forced to retreat, leaving 300 dead or wounded soldiers lying in the field. Martin McClellan was one of them. He died in defence of his country, his home and his family. Also referenced in Historical Notes #29 in the Niagara Times by Janet Carnochan. Janet states that the pocketbook was donated by Mr. Martin McClellan of Fonthill. She then writes about this potentially being the father of Mr. Randall, but the phrase is unusual and may not be so.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/010/9711711(b)-3.jpg,,971.171.1(B),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/010/thumbs/9711711(b)-3.jpg,,,

It also has a linen band trim, a black cockade and a double brass coin chain that run to buttons on the top and bottom. The hat is a regulation issue of 1812 for General staff officers of his Majesty's army. The hat was ordered from England by Sir Isaac Brock and arrived after his death at the battle of Queenston Heights. During his funeral, in 1824 and 1853, the hat was placed on the coffins. Many of the local militia men tried the hat on for size which caused considerable wear to the artefact. This military hat style evolved from the true tri-cornered hat of the early 18th century into the bicorn of the American Revolution--a hat that had a more tightly pinched front corner and a larger fantail at the back of the hat. It is still a three cornered hat but with two of the corners more pronounced. By the 1790's this type of ""cocking"" was more pronounced and the hat looked more like a two cornered hat with a very slight third peak.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/011/9712751(a).jpg,,971.275.1(A),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/011/thumbs/9712751(a).jpg,,War of 1812,

1812,,,,,,,,12/16/1904,Uniform:Coat,"This uniform coatee was worn by Colonel Daniel McDougal when he was an Ensign at the Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The design is for a Junior officer (ensign or lieutenant) of the Volunteer Incorporated Militia Battalion. It is double breasted with an open stand up collar with a thin black lace trim. The cuffs and collar are dark blue with a short turned up tail. It is lined with white linen and the inside lapels are black. The buttons are reproduction brass. McDougal was born in Inverness, Scotland, in 1782 and came to Canada with his parents who settled in Glengarry County. When the war broke out in June 1812, he was in the Glengarry Militia and took part in the capture of Ogdensburg on 22 February 1813. On 20 March he obtained an ensign's commission in the Battalion of Upper Canada Incorporated Militia. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 30 March and is said to have been at Fort George on 27 May when it was taken by the Americans and later at Twelve Mile Creek. He was severely wounded at Lundy's Lane and lying in the field after having been struck seven times, he was initially reported to be ""mortally wounded"". Although he recovered, McDougal had subsequent health problems as well as a lead ball in his body for the rest of his days. He nevertheless lived a long and active life. McDougal's coatee respects Governor Simcoe's 1794 instructions, that is scarlet with blue ""facings"" (i.e. the collar, cuffs and lapels) trimmed with ""plain gilt metal buttons"". To denote his lieutenant's rank, Daniel McDougal wore a gold epaulette with thin gold fringes on the right shoulder only. On 1 June1814, a gold lace edging was ordered added to cuffs and collars on the officers' coatees of the Upper Canada Militia. Thus Lieutenant McDougal's coat was most likely made locally between the date of his first commission, in March 1813 and before the summer of 1814. Being in the field at the time, adding gold edging lace at the collar and cuffs was not an urgent matter for many officers and Lieutenant McDougal's coatee remained plain. The cuffs, quite small and without buttons, are the only exception to this otherwise regulation coatee. When the coatee, now in possession of the museum, was donated a century ago, it was said to be the one that Lieutenant McDougal wore when he was wounded during the Battle of Lundy's Lane. McDougal was in no shape to resume his duties for many months. He was granted a small pension on account of his many wounds. So the coatee, apart from its cuffs, remained much the same as when he wore it in the field. Garments with such a history are rare, even more so if made in Canada and are fitting reminders of the sacrifices made by our forebears to keep our country free.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/972902-8.jpg,,972.902 (A),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/thumbs/972902-8.jpg,,,

1810,,,,,,,,12/14/1904,Uniform:Coat,"This coat was worn by Fort Major Donald Campbell who was buried at Fort George in December 1812. The red wool coat with black flannel wool is a very early type, common shortly after 1800. It features blue facings, buttons in pairs, a rounded cut at the waist and white piping. The high stand-up collar is missing and adjustable lapels. There is a silver epaulet at the left shoulder, but it isn't known whether this is original to the coat. There is also a false pocket on the back. Being the Fort-Major of Fort George (an administrative position) meant you worked directly for the British army and did not report to any particular regiment. Your rank might not even be major. It was usually more junior. As Fort-Major, Campbell could have worn a coat of one of his previous regiments. None of them, however, had blue facings and paired buttons. There is also the possibility that Campbell bought this coat from another officer. It does resemble the warrant for the 10th Royal Veterans Battalion, who were in Canada at that time. It is more likely that this coat was made for Campbell in a generic British officer's style. There appears to be no specific uniform requirement for his position. Campbell had a long and wide-ranging career in the military. In his senior years, the position as Fort-Major would have been very welcome. His family lived with him in Niagara. Campbell died of unknown causes in December 1812, at age 57 and was buried in the central west bastion of Fort George. Campbell's son tried to buy his father's burial plot many years later. It isn't known if the burial site was disturbed during reconstruction of Fort George during the 1930's. The Campbell family suffered through the trials of war in Niagara. They lost a loved one, were caught in the middle of the Battle of Fort George (May 27, 1813), endured American occupation and were burnt out, along with the rest of the town on December 10, 1813.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/972903-2.jpg,,972.903,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/thumbs/972903-2.jpg,,"Fort George, War of 1812",

Document mentions individuals such as Robert Hamilton, George Forfyth, and Thomas Clark.The document mentions connecting the fourth bank of the Chippawa Creek to the shore of fort Erie. The bill instigated the inevitable first Welland Canal as it attempted to connect both lakes as best it could by water, land, and air. The document is intended to mention the economic implications of building the canal and all that intails it.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/9854502.jpg,,985.4.502,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/016/thumbs/9854502.jpg,,Welland Canal,
1798,,,,,,,,12/2/1904,Book,"Published in Glasgow in 1798, this is one of the only known books from the collection of the original Niagara Library still located in our community. It is listed as No. 81 in the handwritten catalogue of the early library's holdings. The bookplate reads Niagara Library 1801 and its purchase price was 4 shillings. The library was founded on June 8, 1800 when forty-one prominent Niagara residents met to form a subscription library which they named the Niagara Library. ""Sensible how much we are at a loss in this new and remote country for every kind of useful knowledge"", the subscribers resolved, ""and convinced that nothing would be of more use to diffuse knowledge amongst us and our offspring, than a library, supported by subscription in this town, we, whose names are hereunto subscribed hereby associate ourselves together for that purpose �."". Andrew Heron (c.1765-1848), a merchant and land speculator resident in Niagara since 1785 was instrumental in the library's organization. The library flourished and by late 1812 offered 827 volumes to its subscribers. However, after the American forces withdrew and burned the town on Dec. 13, 1813 only about 200 books remained and the original Niagara Library was forced to cease operations in 1820. We are so fortunate to still have this book at the Museum as a reminder of our history and of the value placed by our forefathers on establishing a library in our community.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/017/9875417.jpg,,987.5.4.17,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/017/thumbs/9875417.jpg,,Niagara Library,

Sometimes older broadsword blades were cut down and re-used. The blade in this case looks to have lots of wear and early marks.

,,,,,,,,2/4/2023,Declaration,"Declaration of James Richardson, who acted as solicitor for defendants John A Blake and Gertrude L. Blake in partition proceedings brought by Agnes McFarland regarding Lot #52. Transcription is as follows:Ontario Country of YorkIn the matter of lot Number 52 in the Town of Niagara on the Lake in the County of Lincoln.To wit:I, James Richardson Roaf in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, Solicitor, do Solemnly declare:(1) That I acted as solicitor for the Defendants John A. Blake and Gertrude L. Blake in the partition proceedings brought by one Agnes McFarland for the sale or partition of the above mentioned lot and in teh course of the said proceedings I had to make enquiries about the family of the said John A. Blake and the said Agnes McFarland and the different interests in connection with the said property.(2) I found that John Rogers and Mary Rogers subsequently Mary Blake, were brother and sister and that the name of their mother was Agnes Rogers and I believe that the said M. Blake the grantor in the deed of Bargain and sale dated the 4th of December 1835 was the same person as Mary Rogers the grantee in the patent dated the 15th of July 1830.(3) That the said John Rogers was an unmarried man until he was comparatively well on in the years when he married, his wife also being an Agnes Rogers and the said John Rogers when he deceased died interstate leaving him surviving his widow Eliza Ann Rogers and one child Ada Rogers the said John Rogers not having married until the later part of the 19th century and somewhere about the year 1875.(4) That the said property was apparently divided into two parcels (a) On the corner a small portion about 1/7 of an acre upon which was erected two stone stores. (b) The remainder of the said lot upon which was erected a dwelling house which together with the garden surrounded the portion (a) The said dwelling house was occupied by the said Agnes Rogers, mother of John Rogers, and with her lived her son John Rogers and her daughter Mary Blake who had become a widow, and John A. Blake and Agnes McFarland two chuldren of the said Mary Blake. On or about December the 24th 1835 the whole of the said property became vested in the said John Rogers who on the 25th day of January 1836 made a mortgage of the residence and a portion of the said property being parcel (b) above mentioned, to this mother Agnes Rogers to secure an annuity of 25 pounds a year.(5) The said Agnes Rogers subsequently died leaving a will bearing date on or about the 2nd day of April 1862, which will was duly probated and subsequently registered in the registry office of the county of Lincoln as number 12624 whereb shedivised the property for life to her daughter Mary Ann Blake (the above called Mary Blake) with remainder equally between the said Mary Ann Blake, Agnes McFarland and John A. Blake they being the daughter and two of the grandchildren of the said Agnes Rogers. The said Mary Ann Blake subsequently died leaving a will bearing date the 18th of May 1894 whereby she devised all her interest in the said property to her daughter Agnes McFarland who thereupon would be entitled to 2/3 interest or share in the whole property and brought petition proceedings for sale of the said property.(6) In the said proceedings I raised the question that a mortgage having been made by John Rogers to his Mother Agnes Rogers of about 2/3 of the said lot that the deed of quit claim bearing date Sugust 11th 1857 made by the said John Rogers to the said Agnes Rogers a title to the portion of the lands which had not been mortgaged to her and that the said John Rogers or his representative the same being his widow Agnes Rogers and his daughter Ada Rogers might be entitled to a portion of the said property. The said partition proceeding came on for trial at St. Catharines on the 29th day of May 1899 and the Judge the Honourable W.R. Merredith reserved Judgment and after considering the matter and by consent the said Agnes Rogers the widow and Ada Rogers the only daughter of the said John Rogers were added as parties to the said partition proceedings and the proceedings were subsequently continued and in time a sale of the said property was made to Herbert R. Blake and by vesting order made on or about the 4th of July 1902, the interest of Agnes McFarland, John A. Blake, Gertrude L. Blake, to whom the said John A. Blake had conveyed his interest, Agnes Rogers and Ada Rogers were vested in the said H.R. Blake.(7) I also found that the said Blake family and their mother Agnes Rogers and John Rogers had been continually in possession of the said property since about the year 1835 and that no claim could be found adverse to them though the said John Rogers and Mary Ann Blake had given some mortgages which had been held by the Niagara District Building Society but that the said mortgages had been handed over to the said Mary Ann Blake and the same had been paid off and no claim had been made or could be made against the interest of the said parties to teh said partition proceedings.AND I make this solemn Delcaration conscientiously believing it to be true, and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath by the virtue of ""The Canada Evidence Act, 1893.""Declared before me at the City of Toronto in the County of York this first day of February A.D. 1904(no name signed)A Commissioner &c.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/2011031214 (ac).jpg,,2011.031.214 (A-C),https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/2011031214 (ac).jpg,,"Lot 52Niagara-on-the-Lake, Lincoln County",

BlakeMy Dear Sir;-I am glad to inform you that I have got this matter closed. The vesting Order has been granted to you and settled but it will take a day or two to get it entered into the books of the Court and the Certificate for registration, obtained, when I will sent it and some of the title deeds that I have in my possession over to you. In the meantime I enclose you a cheque for $36.96 payable to you, being the amount allowed to you for taxes in arrers on the property and taxes to the first of July, also a cheque to Gertrude L. Blake for $154.19 being her share of the balance of the money in court. I regard the result of this as a practical winning of the case and that the Blake family have come out the best in the litigation. When the proceedings were commenced I understood from your father that he was willing to have $700 or $800 paid to get rid of Mrs. McFarland's claim. The result is you have paid $860 for the property, the family have lived on the property for the last three years and out of the purchase money you are allowed $36.96 for taxes and Mrs. McFarland has paid $74 for taxes, making $110.96 taxes paid out of the purchase money; Miss Gertrude gets back $154.19, making $265, which set off against the $860 leaves under $600 as the price of the property and you have saved the interest for three years. Mrs. McFarland obtains repayment of $74 taxes paid by her and $308.57 for herself, so that she would ahve been far better off if she agreed to make a settlement at the beginning, she would certainly have received more than the $300 for her own use.I have been allowed out of the proceeds of sale $41.00 for fees and the disbursements and fillings paid by me. I enclose you a memorandum of an account, which I do not think exorbitant, for getting the sale put through and getting the deed to you. Mr. Greer gets about $60.00 commission and then also $100 out of the share that was set apart in which the Rogers family were interested. He has certainly not done double the work that I have in the matter so I do not think it would be out of the way to ask you to have you remit me Thirty dollars in connection with the fees of the suit in addition to the fees connected with the purchase of the property. I will state plainly that I would not want to have very many lawsuits in my office to be conducted with as little recompense as this will make in this matter, but I wish to take into account the circumstances connected with the whole transaction and with the position of the family.
