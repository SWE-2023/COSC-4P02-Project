Although completely impractical, thousands of glass canes were crafted in the glasshouses of England, Europe and the United States for over four centuries.For the sheer delight of making lovely and interesting ""objets,"" glassmakers would, on their own time, take the left-over sand, soda ash and lime of their trade and create pieces for their own use and pleasure or to improve their skills. They worked with molten glass to make glass chains, sock darners, bells, rolling pins, horns and walking sticks. These ""Friggers"" in England or ""glasshouse whimsies"" elsewhere were often given as gifts or used to decorate the houses of these master craftsmen.  There are two types of glass canes - the first was made out of a solid piece of twisted glass with spirals of coloured glass forming its core and decorated with a crook or handle. The second was made from blown glass and is hollow with a rounded knob handle. Some of these canes were as tall as five meters.One of the first uses of these sticks was ceremonial - they were carried by glassmakers in their guild parades. Later, copying Marie Antionette's playing the rustic shepherdess at the Petit Trianon, fashionable English ladies carried glass shepherd's crooks decorated with flowers and ribbons. In the nineteenth century, glass canes were part of the costume of some English dandies.The museum's collection of glass whimsies was the gift of the Toronto interior designer, David Whitmore, who owned a house on the corner of Victoria and Johnson until his death in 1998.",GlassworkCanes

To the people of Niagara-on-the-Lake, his business was known as ""Field Drugs"" and his window displays featured toiletries, cosmetic and hair products sold at the location. When Erland's health declined in 1964 he closed the pharmacy, and in 1965, he had made sure that the Niagara Foundation and the Ontario College of Pharmacists had the first right to purchase the property; which was owned by the Niagara Foundation until the Ontario Heritage Foundation acquired the property, restored it and opened it as a museum in 1971. Today the Apothecary still operates as a Museum that is run by the Ontario College of Pharmacists. Erland Field was born and raised in Virgil, Niagara-on-the-Lake and attended the High School located on Castlereagh Street. During the First World War he enlisted in the Canadian Army Medical Corps on June 21, 1915 at Niagara Camp. He was overseas 5 months later where he became part of the Fifth Canadian Field Ambulance, and then in 1917 he was transferred to the First Canadian Clearing Station. He saw service in France, Belgium, and Germany. He retuned home after almost 3 years of service and continued living in Virgil and was an active member in the community.

The Centennial offered the Chiefs of the Six Nations an opportunity to make public their ongoing grievances with the Canadian government. Using their undeniable contribution to the War of 1812, Six Nations Chiefs were actively involved with the ceremonies, making speeches and public appearances to emphasize their sacrifice and continued struggle to have their treaty rights respected.Chief William D. Loft was appointed to create the wreath and it was placed at the base of Brock's Monument at Queenston Heights on October 13, 1912. Inscribed on the surface is ""Six Nations 1812 -1912 - He Rests in Peace - Rodinosyonni"", along with an image of a black bear gripping a bundle of six arrows. During the ceremony, Chief De-ka-nen-ra-neh (A. G. Smith) gave a speech lamenting the lack of justice to the Six Nations in the historical record and expressed a desire to obtain representation in the Canadian House of Commons. The wreath is a poignant reminder of the marginalization of First Nations people and a bold assertion of their desire to be officially recognized by the Canadian government.

Although he did not live in Niagara he did visit quite often.  On several occasions I would see him going to the golf course with a couple of clubs and some golf balls.  I would follow him and watch him hit good shots to the green hoping some day I would be able to hit golf balls as well as he did.  I was only in my early teens at the time.Although there is no evidence of him ever having been a member of the Royal Niagara Golf Club, as it was known at that time, he was associated with the Club and in the early 1900's donated the Servos Trophy for competition by the men.  This trophy is still being played for.Although he was a Canadian, most of his work concerning golf took place in the United States, mostly in Florida.  He designed several of the oldest courses and, as stated in his book, which is reputed to be the first book on golf written in Canada, he would visit there, join up with other golf professionals and play a round.  He says the merchants at that time would close their shops and go out to watch these professional golfers play.Mr. Servos starts his book with the following.  Quote 'Time marches on.  Man Conspires, respires, aspires, and expires.  During which sojourn, if he is fortunate, he plays a little golf and perspires.  He may get so that he plays it very well.  Or he may not be able to play it as well as he would like.  It is for those who would like to improve their golf that this book is published.  For what gaineth a man if he acquire the whole world and yet in unable to play golf.'""",

The advancement of roads and cars and the beginning of the Depression era led to the demise of the Hotel in 1927. After several furnishings were auctioned off the building was demolished in 1930.

He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery.

These expectations meant that girls often received a very different education then boys. Girls were often taught only arithmetic or reading-if their parents could afford to pay for their schooling-along with other skills that were considered to be ""female accomplishments"". This included manners, sewing, painting, music and comportment. Samplers are therefore the most tangible evidence of female education during the early years of Niagara history. To prepare a young girl for the responsibility of sewing for her future family, girls completed at least two samplers. The first, called a marking sampler, was completed when a girl was around 5 or 6 (sometimes older) and served two purposes: to teach basic embroidery and numbers and the alphabet. This sample which was started by Ann Woodruff at around 1800 is a great example of a marking sampler. The sampler appear to be finished later with the addition of her death date.",

The painting is underneath glass and wood framed. The congregation of St. Andrew's Church was established by 1794, possibly earlier.  The Gleaner of 1831 states that the first church was on the site of the present church.  The original church was destroyed as the American forces retreated from the town and set it ablaze in 1813.  Construction of the present Church of St. Andrew's began on May 31st, 1831.  James Cooper was the architect of the building; it mirrors the New England influence on many of the homes that were built in town after the War of 1812.  Members of St. Andrew's Church are treated to one of the most stunning pulpits in the area.  The pulpit and sounding board were fashioned by John Davidson, a local joiner and were a gift from member and benefactor, John Young.  When the new church was complete, pews went to the highest bidder.  The least expensive pew went for £8 and the most expensive went to Jared Stocking for £40.As a child Betty was encouraged by her parents to pursue her artistic skills. She studied in Paris at the age of 21 and was recognized early on for her talent. She was funded by millionaire art patron Duncan Phillips and it was in his gallery in Washington DC where famed artist Henri Matisse took notice of her work. In particular, he remarked on one titled ""The Walls"". Betty moved to Niagara-on-the-Lake in the 1940s with her husband, Gerald Noxon, and son, Nicolas. The family lived in the William Kirby home at 130 Front Street. Her son recalled exploring the countryside together and, at one time, seeing German prisoners of war who were used as labourers. She was inspired by the raw beauty of Niagara-on-the-Lake and the countryside, creating and selling many scenes of the Forts, the lake and the community.

The event was organized by several Italian organizations in London eager to demonstrate their commitment to the Allied cause during the First World War. The illustration featured on this handkerchief is one of many pieces created during the war by Italian artist Fortunino Matania. Matanaia was born in 1881 to the respected Italian artist Eduardo Matania. Eduardo was employed as an artist in the publishing industry and his son seems to have learned from his father how to draw. Fortunino must have quickly picked up the family business quickly because the Italian publication ""L'Illustrazione"" began to receive submissions signed 'Fortunino Matania' when the boy was just 14 years old. Thinking at first that this was a prank being pulled by Eduardo's, the editors were astonished when the young boy arrived at their Milan office and demonstrated his incredible skills and they hired him on the spot.He continued to illustrate for various publishers and served for a time in the Army, becoming a highly capable war artist during World War one. His concern for artistic accuracy was meticulous to the point of eccentricity. He visited the front on several occasions, was provided with military equipment by the War Office, and built a replica trench in the garden of his home near London. This design, known as ""Pro Italia"", is one of 117 of Matania's pictures that were reproduced in London's ""The Sphere"" throughout the war. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1918 and in other major exhibitions in London and Italy. This handkerchief was purchased in support of the Italian Day ceremony by a Niagara-on-the-Lake family member who was serving in Europe and sent it home as a souvenir. The example is unique because it includes the original box it was packaged in. Lightweight souvenirs were ideal for shipping back home, and purchasing this special silk handkerchief also made a statement about one's commitment to the Allied cause during the War.","""Pro Italia""  Allies and Brothers-In-Arms for Justicehandkerchief Italy Britain Italian Day First World WarGreat War"

There are five indecipherable hallmarks on the reverse side of the handle. Hotel Chautauqua/Strathcona, c. 1887Built on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement, a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants’ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",ChautauquaStrathconaHotelSilverware

Over 22,000 American and Canadian men of Polish heritage trained in Ascher's hometown of Niagara-on-the-Lake to fight overseas with the French army in 1917-1918. An outspoken advocate of the restoration of Poland, Elizabeth was committed to increase awareness and support of the movement to restore an independent Polish government. In 1918, a horrific outbreak of Spanish influenza spread among soldiers in Niagara and Elizabeth risked her life to take care of sick soldiers, earning the moniker ""The Angel of Mercy"" among the troops.  The flu claimed the lives of 24 Polish soldiers in training and Ascher immediately began lobbying for the creation of a Polish Military Cemetery at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Elizabeth Ascher's humanitarian efforts continued when she organized a fundraising campaign to help the civilian population in Poland which also sent care packages to Polish soldiers in Europe.  In 1922, Elizabeth was officially recognized for her efforts when she was granted the medal of the Polonia Restituta in 1922. Accolades continued to accumulate for Asher; she was granted the Medal of Haller, the Medal of Haller's Swords, the Polish Cross of Merit and the Polish Medal for Long Service in 1938. Elizabeth continued to serve the Polish cause until her death in 1941, and she is remembered annually on the second Sunday of June at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Niagara-on-the-Lake.

As tangible evidence of their daily work, samplers offer a rare glimpse into the concerns and pursuits of our feminine ancestors. Unfortunately, their fragility and sensitivity to light also means they are seldom on display.  The Niagara Historical Society has exhibited the samplers from its collection only three times in the past two decades.This charming and well-balanced sampler, completed by Augusta Stewart at Niagara in March 1834, is one of 29 samplers in the Niagara Historical Society's permanent collection. It is stitched entirely in cross and Algerian eye stitches; its colours of muted green, tan and gold silk are most likely faded from their original, more vivid hues. Bounded with a regular green and gold border, it features three alphabets, two sets of numerals and ten decorative horizontal bands - some stitched over two threads of linen and some over one. There are two spot motifs: a fruit basket (symbol of fertility) and two evergreen trees (symbols of life). It is damaged in five places.Little is known about Augusta Stewart - her age, her family, whether she remained in Niagara or whether she had any descendants.The most charming thing about her sampler is the inclusion of two opening verses of the Isaac Watts poem praising the industriousness of bees. ""How skillfully she builds her cell,"" stitched young Augusta in her careful way - neatly demonstrating a prized nineteenth century feminine virtue.",Sewing Sampler

https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/969104.jpg,Box:Carpenter's Tool,969.104,1800'S - EARLY,"John Swinton's tool box, which dates from the early 1800's, appears to have a dual purpose.  On the one hand, this apparently plain, wooden chest, painted black with rope handles at each end, was used as a container for his tools.  On the other hand, and perhaps more importantly, as one examines the interior, it becomes obvious that this man used the box as an example of his craftsmanship.  The owner's name is painted on the front and its condition is ""fair - good"".The underside of the lid is made of mahogany-coloured wood, which is cleverly inlaid with a delicate diamond pattern.  Inside the box, at the top, are two wooden trays lying lengthways along the back and along the front, with a space in the middle to provide access to several drawers. The aforementioned trays contain a series of drawers with white knobs and may be moved from front to back on metal channels attached to the interior of each end of the box.  Underneath these top trays is another set of trays, again  with drawers, and again one being in front and one at the back.  Altogether, there are fourteen drawers in the back units, nine in the lower and five in the upper.  As well, the top unit has a hinged lid to provide access to the top section.  The front units have fifteen drawers, nine in the lower, four in the upper and two small drawers, which may be seen at the lower right when the bottom front unit is moved toward the back into the empty space.In the bottom of the box and in the centre cavity are several tools.  These are as follows: two keyhole saws, one large-handled chisel device, one bow saw, two soldering irons, two squares, one axe, one wooden mallet, two two-handled shaving tools, one small claw hammer, one brass compass engraved with the date 1809 and the name, J. Robinson, one marking gauge, one large wooden plane and a set of ten routing planes, each with its own individual design for carving mouldings, cornices, etc.  The large wooden plane and the set of routing planes are all hand-made, most likely by Swinton.All in all, this artefact and its contents demonstrate that John Swinton was a true craftsman.",CarpenterCarpenter Tools

He walked to St. Andrews Church, in Niagara, every Sunday to attend the services. The Willox and Woodruff families share a burial plot in St. Catharines. The material is a walnut case with Adam & Eve on the face and words ""William Willox"". The Clock has quarter columns, a broken pediment arch, roman numerals, and a door in the front panel. The design of the case is a country version of classic Chippendale style, made in Niagara. The Clock face was restored by Mrs. Willox's husband in 1962.","Clock NiagaraRhynie, Scotland"

As a result, there was a large legal community and many high profile cases that took place in town. Accommodating this civil service required a number of different court house buildings over the years, the first of which was burned to the ground by American forces in December of 1813. A replacement was built in 1817 and this chair was soon after brought in to serve as the bench for the presiding judge.One of the earliest neo-Gothic chairs in Ontario, this formal, black walnut chair with leather cushion remained in use when another courthouse was built on Queen Street in 1847. Niagara would lose most of its legal significance in 1862 when the county court was relocated to St. Catharines, with the court house thereafter being used as the Town Hall. A fixture of the building by then, mayors of Niagara used the chair in council meetings until at least 1877, as the chair can be spotted in an 1877 painting of the Hall's interior in the collection of the Toronto Public Library.",Court HouseFurniture

This was a fairly common construction technique employed to increase the capacity of a small piece of horn, or to make the most use of two inferior pieces of horn. Regarding the decorations, they appear to be stylized birds, leaves, and plants, animals, etc. This was quite common with the decorations on First People’s horns.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/009/970143.jpg,Shell Money:Wampum,970.143,,"Wampum beads were manufactured by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people through a difficult and painstaking process through which small, smooth, cylindrical beads were created out of shell.  The word ""wampum"" is derived from the Algonkian word ""wampumpeag."" The beads vary in colour, from white to a dark purple-black, and each colour had a certain value attached to it, with the darker colours being more valuable.  Along with the Haudenosaunee, other nations, largely those along the Northern Atlantic coast, manufactured and used wampum.  Contrary to popular belief, wampum was not used by the Haudenosaunee as a direct form of currency, but rather as a means of exchange or barter.  The beads had many other varied uses, including as a gift, given upon the negotiation of treaties, as a burnt offering upon the death of an individual, as an invitation to council, or even given to the family of a murder victim, as a compensation for the slaying.  Wampum belts, which consist of many beads of varying colour strung together to form often complex patterns were an important diplomatic tool among native peoples and acted like modern day treaties.  Perhaps the best known of these belts is entitled The Hiawatha Belt, which memorializes the Iroquois Great Law of Peace, which united the original five nations, which were later joined by the sixth, the Tuscaroras.  The Great Law represents one of the earliest forms of diplomacy, and has lasted far beyond modern treaties and alliances.  Wampum belts, in various patterns, were also used to seal agreements with Europeans, including the Jesuits, and the Vatican.",

Tea was such a valued commodity it was traded as we might trade petroleum today; the term ""under lock and key"" may be applied to give us an idea of how valued this consumable luxury was to our forbearers. In a household of great means the master or mistress would hold a key, as would a senior and trusted member of staff. The ceremony would begin with the caddy being opened to reveal a silver foil lined compartment or compartments and in some cases a crystal mixing bowl. This bowl was used to blend the exotic teas. When the tealeaves were considered to have been well used, or simply spent, the ""slop"" would return to the pantry or kitchens, where it would be stretched by the lesser mortals of the household for a much weaker mug of tea. It might be said that it is a rare thing to find a tea caddy made of such exotic and valued materials such as tortoise shell, mother of pearl and abalone, fruitwoods, silver, silver-gilt, or even gold.

In the 1820s and 1830s, trade in Montreal, the colony's commercial centre, created a strong demand for coinage. As coins were often in short supply, privately produced tokens filled the void. Tokens were not legal tender and their circulation was against the law. However, this was little deterrent at a time when legal coins were scarce. The first private coppers were heavy pieces, about the same weight as the penny and halfpenny coins they supplemented.However, by the 1830s the tokens were barely half the weight of the official coins and, at times, were so numerous that people would no longer accept them. Various tricks were therefore resorted to in order to make their circulation possible. One interesting approach was to copy the designs of tokens that had previously been of heavy weight and had enjoyed wide circulation. About 1832 a Montreal grocer named Tiffin issued copper halfpenny tokens. They bore the date 1812 and were imitations of much heavier pieces produced twenty years earlier. The obverse carried a bust of King George III surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves and acorns and the figure of a seated woman representing Commerce was the design on the reverse.

Brock was killed on 13 October 1812 during an attack by invading U.S. forces at Queenston Heights on the Niagara frontier. During the war, private tokens began circulating in great quantity in British North America due to a severe currency shortage caused by increased commercial activity, and to an initial distrust of the series of paper notes known as ""army bills'' issued by Brock.

Following the retreat of American forces from Niagara and the subsequent burning of the town, the British wasted no time reoccupying the ruins of Fort George and planning an assault on Fort Niagara. More than five hundred soldiers crossed the Niagara River to Five Mile Meadows on the night of December 19, 1813 and silently turned north toward Youngstown. American pickets stationed in the village were taken by surprise, and the attackers obtained the garrison password. A short march carried them to Fort Niagara where they burst through a partially open gate and caught the garrison unprepared. With Fort Niagara secured, the British and their Indian allies marched back upriver, destroying farms and villages on the New York side as far as Manchester (present day Niagara Falls). A second British raid at the end of December burned Buffalo and completed the devastation of the Niagara Frontier. Only the buildings of Fort Niagara were left intact to shelter a British garrison. An officer indicated surrender by offering his sword to his conqueror.  The sword, then, became the symbol of the victory and was surpassed only by an enemy's flag or ""colours"" and by his artillery pieces as trophies of war.

William Claus was born in 1765 into a prominent Loyalist family.  In 1787 he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the British Army in the Sixtieth Regiment of Foot and was promoted to Captain in 1795.  The following year he settled in Niagara where he became Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Department at Fort George; responsible for the Six Nations of the Grand River.  In 1797, Claus was appointed Trustee for the Six Nations, particularly the Ojibwa, and the following year named Deputy Superintendent General for Upper Canada.  He was also a Lieutenant in the Incorporated Militia of Oxford County.  By 1803 he was a Justice of the Peace, a Trustee of the Niagara Public School and Commissioner of Customs for the Niagara District. In 1807 he began realigning the British Government with the chiefs of the Six Nations against the Americans.  He was appointed to the Legislative Council and when the War of 1812 broke out, he was a Colonel in the First Lincoln Militia and Flank Commander of the British Regulars at Fort George and Queenston Heights.  It was at this time that he was lent the dispatch case.  Following the war he was appointed to the prestigious Executive Council of the province and was responsible for negotiating the division of customs with Lower Canada.  Claus obtained £500 from the British Government toward restoring St. Mark's Church, in Niagara-on-the-Lake, following the war and in 1820 he negotiated the government's agreement with the Mississauga and Ojibwa.

Martin McClellan visited her in Virgil and provided his wife with his watch and this pocketbook.  He told his wife that he would never see her or their children again.    For 5 days, McClellan could see what the rest of the British garrison in Niagara could see.  Across the Niagara River, thousands of American troops on parade around Fort Niagara, workers preparing batteries and boats and 17 armed vessels returning triumphantly from the burning of York.  McClellan and the small garrison in Niagara would be no match.As fog lifted at daybreak the following day, McClellan would see 16 ships, 134 boats and scows (each with 30 - 50 American soldiers) two miles from the Town of Niagara.  By 9 o'clock, some 2,300 American soldiers started the land assault under the cover of heavy artillery.  The British defence was approximately 567 men, both regulars and militia.  It took several attempts for the Americans to assemble on a plain at the western end of the town.  McClellan was in line with the rest of his company facing the U.S. forces a mere 5 - 10 meters away.  The two sides fought for over 15 minutes.  In the end, the British were forced to retreat, leaving 300 dead or wounded soldiers lying in the field.  Martin McClellan was one of them.   He died in defence of his country, his home and his family.       Also referenced in Historical Notes #29 in the Niagara Times by Janet Carnochan.

That year he was appointed professor of eye, ear, and throat diseases at Trinity Medical School, launching a teaching career which would continue until 1918. Also in 1880 he became surgeon at the Andrew Mercer Eye and Ear Infirmary in the Toronto General Hospital. Ryerson was responsible for a number of innovations in Canadian medicine such as a recognition of the perils of colour blindness. Nevertheless he regretted ""that with the fine training I had had in Europe I did not do any original work in my profession.""When he retired from the medical profession in 1920 he was an affluent man and he withdrew to a large estate, Peaceacres, in Niagara-on-the-Lake. There he wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1924, appropriately by Ryerson Press, as Looking backward. Having returned to Toronto to live, he died there the next year of a heart attack following a brief illness.- Peter E. Paul Dembski, ""Dictionary of Canadian Biography""",

III 1879 rifle with a walnut stock and steel barrel with an Enfield stamp. The firing mechanism is one with breech loading and a cartridge ejector. Was likely used during the First World War and possibly the Second World War as well (the shoulder strap attached to the rifle is WWII era), but the exact dates of use are unknown.This rifle was featured in ""100 Years, 100 Artefacts"" and this description was prepared by Neil Middleton.""This steel barreled, Italian walnut stocked Martin Henry (Enfield) rifle was used by those Niagara militiamen who participated, under the command of Colonel Sir Frederick Middleton, in the suppression of the Northwest Rebellion of 1885.  The rifle had been adopted by the British army and Canadian militia in 1871 and continued in service into the 20th century.  It was the first purpose-designed breech loading rifle in the British Army (slightly incorrect - the Ferguson Rifle was produced and used on a very small scale during the American Revolutionary War).  It was a combination of the falling block mechanism devised by Frederich Martini (1832-97), a Swiss gunsmith and the seven-groove rifling devised by Edinburgh gunsmith Alexander Henry (1817-95). The Martini-Henry was popular with the soldiers because it only weighed 9 lb (4 kg) unloaded, was very robust, easy to strip and clean, and had few and easily replaceable parts.As for Middleton, he was born in Belfast, Ireland, in 1825 and saw service in many parts of the British Empire, including Quebec where he had married Eugénie Doucet of Montreal.  In 1884, he had accepted the normally placid position of General Officer commanding Canada's militia.  As a consequence of his victory over the ill-equipped Métis rebels at the Battle of Batoche (in what is now Saskatchewan) on 12 May 1885, and the capture of their leader Louis Riel three days later, Middleton was granted a gift of $20,000 from the Parliament of Canada and given a knighthood by Queen Victoria.  He resigned command of the Canadian Militia in 1890 and returned to Great Britain where he was rewarded with the sinecure of Keeper of the Crown Jewels. He died in 1898.""In January 2010 Steven Baxter added these notes on the rifle:Martini-Henry Mk I–IVType: Service riflePlace of origin: United KingdomService historyIn service: 1871–1918Used by: United Kingdom  & ColoniesWars: British colonial wars, Second Anglo-Afghan War, Anglo-Zulu War, Boer War, Mahdist War, World War IProduction historyDesigner: RSAF EnfieldDesigned: 1870Manufacturer: VariousProduced: 1871–c.1891Number built: approx. 500,000–1,000,000Variants: Martini-Henry CarbineSpecifications:Weight 8 pounds 7 ounces (3.827 kg) (unloaded), 9 pounds, 4.75 ounces (with sword bayonet)Length 49 inches (124.5 cm)Cartridge: .577/450 Martini-HenryCalibre: .577/450 Martini-HenryAction: Martini Falling Block /Peabody actionRate of fire: 10 rounds/minuteMuzzle velocity: 900 ft/s (270 m/s)Effective range: 600 yd (550 m)Maximum range: 1,500 yd (1,400 m)Feed system: Single shotSights: Sliding ramp rear sights, Fixed-post front sightsThe Martini-Henry saw service in World War I in a variety of roles—primarily as a Reserve Arm, but it was also issued (in the early stages of the war) to aircrew for attempting to shoot down observation ballons and other aircraft.

In his declining years George lived at ""Locust Grove"" in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The breeches were fashioned from camel coloured wool felt and feature pewter and brass buttons on the legs and cuffs. The breeches also have a brown triangular shaped piece on the back of the waistband. Though the colour is faded, more protected areas reveal the original rich hue. Wear marks on the breeches are absent. There is also a fall front of 8"" wide, 2 suspender buttons on the front and back, buttons and buttonholes at the knee and a buttonhole for a knee buckle. The 1810's style breeches were more fitted and the length extended to the knee where stockings or high boots covered the lower leg. Metal buttons fastened the drop front and would have held suspenders. Large pockets on either side appear to have a wing detail because of a two inch extension of the pocket above its outside seam. One small pocket on the front right side presumably housed a watch. Buttons are reinforced and the inner waist band measuring 34""is lined with linen. The shorter jacket front of this period dictated a higher waistline and drop front to cover the fly. Approaching 1820, fashion changed in favour of full length pants.",

Pattens are a protective overshoe that were worn outdoors to keep the wearer elevated above the mud/dirt before urban paving was introduced. Pattens were popular right from the Middle Ages to the late-19th century. This patten shows a wooden sole with leather and velvet strap over the ankle; an iron ring attached to the bottom gives the patten the height it needed.This patten was featured in the book, ""100 Years, 100 Artefacts"" which has this to say, ""How many times have you heard the phrase ""She is a slipshod housekeeper"" or ""that work is slipshod""?  I was intrigued to discover the derivation offered in Lorraine O'Byrne's (Former Curator of Black Creek Pioneer Village) booklet ""What is it?""  The picture showed a farm woman ""slippershod"", elevated some five centimetres on top of pattens: two oval iron rings separated by two struts under a thin wooden sole with leather straps tied over the instep.  Her skirt and petticoats were lifted and the slippers saved from dirt or snow when she gardened or collected eggs from coop or root cellar.  Upper class women with servants went out for walks outdoors.  Neither beaded moccasins nor silk slippers stand up to the ground without pattens.  Pattens are centuries old.  Elizabeth Semmelhack (Curator Bata Shoe Museum) explained that the dating depends on the sole's toe shape: almond shaped in the 1760's to pointier towards 1800 and squarish from 1800-1850's.  (This is) most likely from the 1770's or 1780's.Wooden shoes and clogs were universal.  Colonial ""wedding shoes"" - leather sole, instep, and wooden 5-7cm heel covered with brocade- needed clogs to lift all off the dirt so the shoes could last for church and parties.As the horses needed ""shoes"" to prevent slipping, so the shoe makers needed blacksmiths to create pattens.  They were practical and saved our pioneer women from being merely slippershod (slipshod) to having a better understanding for all the hard work needed.""",
https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/972259.jpg,Dress,972.259,1805 C.,"After decades of wide hips and tightly laced torsos, a shift in fashion occurred at the end of the 1700s. Women's clothing was influenced by the early Greek and Roman style and was made from light-weight fabrics. The waistline rose significantly and sat under the bust to create a straight silhouette. Dresses either had short puffed sleeves or were long and narrow. This silhouette remained through the 1810's, but dresses were now made from heavier textiles.  This dress, dated to the late-1700s to ca. 1809, adheres to the fashion of this period as it is made of light weight cotton muslin, features puffed sleeves, and the waistline sits right under the bust, which is a drop front bust. The skirt has a slight train. The documentation on this dress originally stated that it was worn by Anne Smith, the daughter of the First Surveyor General of Upper Canada, D.W. Smith. However, Anne would have been too young to wear a dress of this people. Research indicates that it was likely worn by Jane Isabella (nee Clark) Smith, the wife of Samuel Smith, who was the Administrator of the Province.

The style of quilt hit its craze in the late Victorian era when quilting started to morph from a necessary domestic task to a leisure activity. A great example of the Crazy Quilt style in the collection is a Crazy Quilt made from pieces of embroidery completed by Laura Secord. The quilt was compiled by Augusta Smith, Laura's granddaughter. Note that the quilt was never completed. The butterfly embroidered on the quilt is very reminiscent of a drawing (988.294) that was done by Laura Secord and copied by Miss. Goring.It is not clear if all the embroidery on the quilt was made by Laura or if her granddaughter had a hand in adding her own personal touches to the quilt. According to Janet Carnochan and her research (NHS 25), Laura was always very kind and thoughtful to children and to many of the old soldiers, who had served with her husband. She was very fond of gardening, and the flowers embroidered on this quilt may reflect this passion.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/97265.jpg,Waistcoat,972.65,1780 C.,"Ready-made clothing was scarce in Niagara in the late 1700s. While there was demand from the newly arrived loyalist settlers, there were few skilled tailors and clothes were expensive. An individual's wardrobe was limited and was manufactured with the intention that it would last for many years. Moreover, cloth was expensive and difficult to obtain in Upper Canada, nearly every yard had to be imported. This waistcoat was not designed for utility, setting it apart from the clothing worn by most of the early settlers in Niagara in the late 1700s. Adorned with false pockets, floral trim and steel beads, this silk waistcoat is clearly identifiable as the property of a wealthy individual. Robert Hamilton, the owner of this garment, was one of the most influential settlers in early Upper Canada. He began his business in 1780 in Queenston and made a fortune provisioning the British military and First Nations refugees from the United States. Supplying these groups required immense resources and Hamilton was quick to capitalize on the demand. He went on to build an extensive network of merchandising and land speculation which had a tremendous impact on the settlement pattern of Niagara, most of which he personally oversaw through his active involvement in local politics. Hamilton was criticized for using his position as Justice of the Peace, Judge of the Court of Common Peace and Member of the Land Board to advance his own business interests, all of which had a lasting impact on the community at Niagara. A merchant and politician, Hamilton was the main wholesaler of grain, held most of the settler's mortgages, supplied a majority of the goods and was the primary purchaser of the lands of the early settlers. This garment would have been worn as he served in his various court functions and is a fitting reminder of Robert Hamilton's patronage and power. Hamilton's legacy remains in Niagara in the settlement pattern, the roads, and personal artifacts such as this elegant waistcoat.",

Generally native families had only what was essential for their daily lives. Hence games were most popular as they could simply be played with materials found at the sites.  What toys they had were made of locally available material and expendable.  Indigenous dolls were most often made of cattails, cornstalks and other natural materials found locally.The fact that there are painted features on this doll is notable as most native dolls were faceless as it was feared the doll would turn into the person it represented if too much detail was on the doll.  The doll is dressed in the ordinary costume of a Six Nations woman. She is made of wood and papier-mâché. The materials are of European influence.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/972902-8.jpg,Uniform:Coat,972.902 (A),1812,"This uniform coatee was worn by Colonel Daniel McDougal when he was an Ensign at the Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The design is for a Junior officer (ensign or lieutenant) of the Volunteer Incorporated Militia Battalion. It is double breasted with an open stand up collar with a thin black lace trim. The cuffs and collar are dark blue with a short turned up tail. It is lined with white linen and the inside lapels are black. The buttons are reproduction brass. McDougal was born in Inverness, Scotland, in 1782 and came to Canada with his parents who settled in Glengarry County.  When the war broke out in June 1812, he was in the Glengarry Militia and took part in the capture of Ogdensburg on 22 February 1813.  On 20 March he obtained an ensign's commission in the Battalion of Upper Canada Incorporated Militia.  He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 30 March and is said to have been at Fort George on 27 May when it was taken by the Americans and later at Twelve Mile Creek.  He was severely wounded at Lundy's Lane and lying in the field after having been struck seven times, he was initially reported to be ""mortally wounded"".  Although he recovered, McDougal had subsequent health problems as well as a lead ball in his body for the rest of his days.  He nevertheless lived a long and active life. McDougal's coatee respects Governor Simcoe's 1794 instructions, that is scarlet with blue ""facings"" (i.e. the collar, cuffs and lapels) trimmed with ""plain gilt metal buttons"".  To denote his lieutenant's rank, Daniel McDougal wore a gold epaulette with thin gold fringes on the right shoulder only.  On 1 June1814, a gold lace edging was ordered added to cuffs and collars on the officers' coatees of the Upper Canada Militia.  Thus Lieutenant McDougal's coat was most likely made locally between the date of his first commission, in March 1813 and before the summer of 1814.  Being in the field at the time, adding gold edging lace at the collar and cuffs was not an urgent matter for many officers and Lieutenant McDougal's coatee remained plain.  The cuffs, quite small and without buttons, are the only exception to this otherwise regulation coatee. When the coatee, now in possession of the museum, was donated a century ago, it was said to be the one that Lieutenant McDougal wore when he was wounded during the Battle of Lundy's Lane.  McDougal was in no shape to resume his duties for many months.  He was granted a small pension on account of his many wounds.  So the coatee, apart from its cuffs, remained much the same as when he wore it in the field. Garments with such a history are rare, even more so if made in Canada and are fitting reminders of the sacrifices made by our forebears to keep our country free.",
https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/972903-2.jpg,Uniform:Coat,972.903,1810,"This coat was worn by Fort Major Donald Campbell who was buried at Fort George in December 1812. The red wool coat with black flannel wool is a very early type, common shortly after 1800.  It features blue facings, buttons in pairs, a rounded cut at the waist and white piping.  The high stand-up collar is missing and adjustable lapels.  There is a silver epaulet at the left shoulder, but it isn't known whether this is original to the coat.  There is also a false pocket on the back. Being the Fort-Major of Fort George (an administrative position) meant you worked directly for the British army and did not report to any particular regiment.  Your rank might not even be major.  It was usually more junior.    As Fort-Major, Campbell could have worn a coat of one of his previous regiments.  None of them, however, had blue facings and paired buttons.  There is also the possibility that Campbell bought this coat from another officer.  It does resemble the warrant for the 10th Royal Veterans Battalion, who were in Canada at that time.  It is more likely that this coat was made for Campbell in a generic British officer's style.  There appears to be no specific uniform requirement for his position.   Campbell had a long and wide-ranging career in the military.  In his senior years, the position as Fort-Major would have been very welcome.  His family lived with him in Niagara.  Campbell died of unknown causes in December 1812, at age 57 and was buried in the central west bastion of Fort George.  Campbell's son tried to buy his father's burial plot many years later.  It isn't known if the burial site was disturbed during reconstruction of Fort George during the 1930's.    The Campbell family suffered through the trials of war in Niagara.  They lost a loved one, were caught in the middle of the Battle of Fort George (May 27, 1813), endured American occupation and were burnt out, along with the rest of the town on December 10, 1813.",Fort GeorgeWar of 1812
https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/029/9729041.jpg,Uniform:Coat,972.904.1,1825-40 C.,"Following the War of 1812, Niagara remained a hotbed of military activity. There was concern about republican ideas spreading into Canada and the McKenzie rebellion of 1837 prompted an increased military presence to combat these threats. The 1st King's Dragoon Guards regiment was called from England to help put down the McKenzie uprising and they arrived in Niagara in 1838. A heavy cavalry regiment, The King's Dragoon Guards were renowned for their skill on horseback and their attractive uniforms generated great interest among the citizens in the Niagara area. One recalled the regiment as ""perhaps the finest military body that ever came to the district… officered by men of wealth and title. The men were all six feet in height with fine well-trained horses.""This uniform belonged to one of these imposing men, Sergeant-Major Adam Flanigan. Flanigan was born in 1810 in Ballymena, North Ireland and joined his regiment in Canada in 1840. One of the tasks given to the regiment was the renovation of Fort Mississauga, which probably meant updating its defensive capabilities. While stationed in Niagara, Sergeant-Major Flanigan met and married Agnes Richardson and they settled down to raise a family on Johnson Street in town (Niagara-on-the-Lake). Adam and Agnes were well-known in the local community and had a son William -who died in infancy- and two daughters, Mary and Isabella. At some point in the 1850's Adam broke his hip and was never able to walk again. The Reverend Thomas Creen, rector of St. Mark's Church frequently visited the disabled veteran for company and probably also to administer Church services. Adam died at age 52 and was buried September 16, 1862 in St. Mark's Churchyard in Niagara-on-the-Lake.  His uniform jacket, along with his helmet and other accoutrements were donated to the local museum and serve as a striking reminder of the extensive military tradition in the Niagara region.",

It is a single breasted green coat with a velvet trimmed stand up collar and cuffs. There are also three rows of buttons down the front. Decorative lace on the face and cuffs has been removed and the wings are missing from the shoulder. Theory states that this jacket belonged to Ensign Donald McDougald who served in the militia unit on the Niagara frontier during the War of 1812 (987.5.464). He was also in the 2nd Regiment of the Glengarry Militia as a Lieutenant as of September 1st 1839. This might mean that the tunic was his during the later stages of his service to the Militia. The coat could possibly be from 1812, however the buttons put it at a later date. The curved ""heart shaped"" pattern of the buttons on each side of the breast is different from the 1812-1815 straight pattern.   Little is known of Glengarry Militia Coatees and Glengarry Light Infantry (GLIF) Uniforms.  At first, this coat was documented as a GLIF uniform, but current research dispells that, however, continued research is required on this uncommon artefact.   It is possible that components of the uniform are from the War of 1812 as well, as many Militia coats were used well after the War of 1812 by soldiers as the continued in their Militia service, being changed and modified to reflect the changes to new uniforms.",

It is a double breasted coat made with red brushed wool broadcloth with black lace on dark blue wool lapels, collar and cuffs. The coat also features a stand-up collar, a skirt at the back and a single epaulet on the right shoulder. Four pairs of buttons adorn the front of the lapels which read ""British Militia"" and the royal cipher of King George III. John McMicking, who resided in Stamford (now part of Niagara Falls), fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights during the War of 1812. Some of the uniform features appear to be later than 1812, including the shield shaped lapels, the domed buttons, and the gold lace on the edge of the cuffs, which could mean that McMicking's uniform was modified after the war. This artifact has been in the care of the Niagara historical Museum for over a century, revealing the extent to which Niagara valued the participation of their forefathers in the War of 1812.",

It is believed to be a staff officer uniform and has five pairs of buttons down the front with the ""GR"" cipher of the British Militia.  This wool coat is double breasted with adjustable or reversible lapels. There is also fine black and gold lace on the stand up collar and the small of the back and two epaulettes on the shoulder.  This coat most likely predates the War of 1812, but soldiers would have several coats available to them depending on the situation. Shaw was born in Scotland and was the 2nd son of Angus (14th Chief of the Clan Shaw) and Anne Shaw. He was in the Queen's Rangers during the American Revolution, the  same unit that Lt. Gov. John Graves Simcoe commanded. He was given permanent rank in the British Army on December 25, 1782 and following the Revolution, he settled in Fredericton, (Nashwaak Village) New Brunswick. He married a Nancy Ann Gorsline of Newtown, Long Island in 1783 and who died in 1806 after giving him 7 sons. He came to Newark with John Graves Simcoe in 1792 and moved his family to Newark (Niagara) in 1793 where served as a member of the executive council from 1794 to 1807. With his military background in the American Revolution, he was appointed Adjutant General of the Militia in 1807. As the major-general of the militia in 1811 he was responsible for training the colonies militia leading up to the War of 1812. He died at York, Upper Canada on February 6, 1814.",War of 1812

The building was also used by officers of the Niagara Harbor and Dock Company (Philip Delatre in 1832 and Robert Melville in 1843).  In 1846 the building was purchased by Richard Howard, former owner of the Angel Inn. Although the building looks small there was a long frame wing out in behind.  The hotel was apparently named Promenade house due to the habits of its clientele - sundry ladies of the night. It is also believed that the building was used as a grammar school for a time and as a residence for some  Polish Officers during the First World War.

I also remember that the Rands always had a July 4th celebration, to which townspeople were invited and which I attended several times.There were four Rand children, two of them girls.  I remember them dressed in these short dresses towards the end of the 1920s, which was the Flapper Era.The Rands were one of the many Americans who summered in Niagara-on-the-Lake.

The Underwood had arrived.The Underwood typewriter was the first widely successful modern typewriter. It pulled together the three main design elements that would be found on all later machines, a four-row straight keyboard, front striking type-bars (giving visible typing) and one shift key. The Underwood was not the first to offer these essential features, the Daugherty was in 1893, but it was by far the best engineered machine to have done so by 1896.Franz Wagner, a brilliant engineer who was involved with the Caligraph and other pioneering typewriters, sold his invention to the John Underwood & Co., a major supplier of typewriter ribbons.

This department was responsible for the supply of cannons, weapons, powder, and ammunition of all kinds, and was also in charge of the maintenance and construction of fortifications and barracks. Objects belonging to the Board of Ordnance were marked with a small arrow and ""B.O."". Along with supplying materials and constructing forts, the Board of Ordnance also supplied a wide range of engineering and technical services not only to the armed forces but also to civilians. The impact of the Board of Ordnance on Canadian infrastructure cannot be understated, as the Board was directly involved with the construction of canals including the Rideau and Welland Canals, which contributed greatly to the economic development of Ontario in the early 1800's.This uniform, which dates to the 1830's, was worn by William Duff, who served as the Barracks Master of Fort Malden. The Duffs were prominent early settlers of present-day Windsor, and William served as an Adjutant at Fort Malden in Amherstberg during the War of 1812. Of exceptional quality and in immaculate condition, Duff's uniform has been considered the finest surviving example of its kind. Along with the uniform coat are a bicorn hat and gold epaulettes, both of which remain with their original metal boxes. The uniform offers a glimpse into the past of an under-examined part of Canadian heritage and serves as a reminder of the Board of Ordnance's profound impact on the development of Canada",Board of Ordnance

It depicts two hands shaking at the top centre above the date 1836, followed by the words ""Niagara District Mutual Fire Insurance Co.""  The plaque is made of iron and is faded green, yellow, brown and black in colour.Open fires were an essential part of living in those days, used for heating in winter and cooking throughout the year.  But with many fires often unprotected and unguarded, and many houses made almost entirely of wood, serious fires were quite common and often devastating.  The intention was that the homeowner displayed the plaque on the outside of his house so that fire fighters, arriving to extinguish the fire, would see the plaque and know that they would be paid by the insurance company upon successful completion of their job.  It is said that fire brigades would sometimes refuse to put out a fire if there was no immediate evidence of fire insurance on the property.Indeed, fire was so ever-present and potentially catastrophic at that time that it became common for many insurance companies to own and operate their own fire brigades until that responsibility was passed over to local government in 1866.  In Niagara-on-the-Lake there is one known fire insurance plaque on a house dating from those times.

He originally worked for his cousin, Robert Hamilton, the enormously successful Queenston merchant and shipowner whose enterprises were based on the portage route around Niagara Falls.  Dickson soon went into business for himself in Niagara, selling supplies to both the military garrison and to the local settlers.  By 1790, Dickson had become a successful businessman and is credited with building the first brick house in the Niagara peninsula.     In 1794, Dickson married Charlotte Adlam; they eventually had three sons.  He was a member of the Niagara Library and of the Niagara Agricultural Society, a trustee of the district grammar school, and a justice of the peace.  In 1803, Dickson was given a special license by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada to practise law which he did for a number of years, at times acting as judge of the District Court.      During the War of 1812, Dickson was arrested by invading American forces and was being held as a prisoner in Albany, when the town of Niagara was burned in December 1813.  Lost in the fire was not only a house recently built on a large tract of land he had purchased south of the Commons but also a magnificent library of 1,000 volumes.  As the town began its process of rebuilding following the war, it benefited from the gift of a part of Dickson's land tract upon which the second Courthouse was built.     Dickson then turned his attention to his large land holdings along the Grand River.There, he aided a group of Pennsylvania Mennonites in a difficult transaction.  He made arrangements with agents in Scotland to encourage immigration to his land.  Dickson was known for his paternal treatment of the settlers, advancing large sums of money, not requiring substantial down payments, and ensuring that they had stock, implements, and provisions.  Once his settlements were prosperous, Dickson returned to Niagara where he died in 1846.",

In 1813 Niagara was burnt by the retreating American, St. Mark's was gutted by fire, only it's stone walls were left standing. The congregation set about slowly rebuilding within the walls of the old stone church. In 1822 the church was finally rededicated. By the late 1840's the population of the parish had grown to the point where the old church was too small. The transepts and chancel were added and completed in 1843, creating a cruciform plan, but still with it's Classical detail.

Was it painted prior to 1833 as the inscription states or later, after he settled in Hamilton, as is more likely?

Under his white robe is the red jacket given to him by a British officer for his help as a messenger during the American Revolution. Stanley trained as a portrait painter, and all of the figures in this work are portraits of identifiable individuals. ""The Trial of Red Jacket"" was almost destroyed in the Smithsonian Institution's fire of 1865.

The colours are autumnal and among the bright yellow trees are smartly dressed on-lookers, both officials and local citizens. On the reverse of the print is the text:""In 1791 a Bill known as The Constitutional Act was passed in the British Parliament, dividing distance of the western part of the colony from the seat of government at Quebec, and also that the French in Lower Canada might retain their own system of government, while for the English in Upper Canada might be created a system in harmony with their traditions.Colonel John Graves Simcoe, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and a man of wide experience, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. He arrived, at Quebec, in late autumn and spent the winter there.The induction of Governor Simcoe was celebrated at Kingston on the 18th of July 1792, amidst the most primitive surroundings, yet with military pomp and ceremony.His Executive Council was Formed of:Messrs.:William Osgood, Chief Justice,James Baby,Alexander Grant,Peter Russell, Receiver General,In addition to these wereRobert Hamilton,Richard Cartwright,John Munro,Members of the Legislative Council ,Among the Members of the Legislative Assembly, an Elective Body, were:Messrs.:John White - Attorney General,John Macdonell,E.

On the west bank of the picturesque Niagara, within sound, on a calm day, of the mighty cataract, was built the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, known as Navy Hall, and, within its log walls, the first Parliament of Upper Canada assembled on the 17th of September 1792. The artist has made a most artistic and interesting picture of Simcoe opening his little Parliament with all the dignity and ceremony at his command. No matter if the place of meeting was only a plain structure of wood, and the members of the House few in number, a new State had come into being; cannon roared in salute; the Lieutenant-Governor, mounted and in full military uniform, was received and escorted by a Guard of Honour from the Northumberland Fusiliers, elaborate in their striking military equipment. He entered the Chamber with stately bearing. The members of the House were summoned to his presence and he made his Speech from the Throne on the exact model of Westminster.The picture has been reconstructed from the best available records.

After his death on October 13, 1812, during the Battle of Queenston Heights, he was buried at his first resting place at one of the bastions at Fort George. But it was decided the ""hero"" of Upper Canada deserved a more suitable memorial, and in 1824, he, along with his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell, were buried beneath the monument in October of 1824.  The vault beneath the monument was not going to be his final resting place.On April 17, 1840, the monument was damaged by a gunpowder bomb. It is believed that Irish-Canadian, Benjamin Lett, who was involved in William Lyon Mackenzie's 1837 Rebellion, was the culprit. The remains of Brock were moved to the Hamilton family cemetery on the grounds of Willowbank in Queenston, until they could reinterred under a new monument on October 13, 1853.",

These handcrafted mementos were created by local women and sold to soldiers through regimental canteens. Beautifully embroidered, poignantly sentimental, and unabashedly patriotic, thousands of souvenirs like these were sent back home to loved ones by Canadian soldiers. Many of the handkerchiefs are dated 1918, and celebrate the end of the war. Part of the reason souvenir handkerchiefs were so popular, and that so many still exist today is that they were lightweight, making them an ideal souvenir to send back home from the front.",First World War1918 Souvenir de FranceHandkerchiedTextile

Cheavin's around 1890 and was found in the home located at 289 Simcoe Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Water treatment was not a new concept in history, but this was the first time that (we know of) ceramic was used to remove dirt and bacteria from drinking water. When Queen Victoria realised that there was a heath danger associated with her drinking water, she commissioned John Doulton in 1835 to produce a water filter for the Palace. He created a gravity fed stoneware filter that used the technology of a ceramic filter with the artistry of hand-crafted pottery. Eventually this creation was manufactured and sold to other households to help keep drinking water safe for everyone.",

Around 1888, the Town Council for Niagara decided that the Town's water supply needed to be modernized by building a water plant. During this time much of the community's water came from springs, the lake, and unsanitary private wells. Some townspeople were not in support of this project either because the town could not afford it or because they felt they did not need one. Eventually, the project went forward and in 1891 the Town of Niagara's Municipal Waterworks Plant was built!The water plant, made of brick with a tall stack, was located along the shore of the Niagara River, just off Ricardo Street. For 92 years this plant was the pumping station that supplied the town with water from the Niagara River. Overtime this building has affectionately become known as the ""Pumphouse"".",

In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949. The sketches in the collection of the Niagara Historical Museum we completed in the 1950's. John G. Williams died in 1960.This remarkable property—four heavily forested acres in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake---has passed intact through many hands since its origin as a crown grant to a veteran of Butler’s Rangers in 1796.  The first private purchaser was Robert Pilkington, a military engineer in the intimate circle of John Graves Simcoe, who assigned Pilkington numerous commissions to erect fortifications and public buildings in Upper Canada.  After only a year of ownership, Pilkington conveyed the property in 1799 to Ann Claus, in a most unusual transaction. Ann Claus was the daughter of the colonial magnate Sir William Johnson, the widow of  Johnson’s chief assistant in the Indian Department, and the mother of William Claus who in 1796 succeeded John Butler as deputy Indian commissioner for the Six Nations reserve. According to the records, the purchase money was obtained by the sale of reserve land, the tribes then conveying the town property to Ann Claus in gratitude for her (deceased) husband’s ""many kindnesses"", a piece of business which could have been transacted only with the permission and guidance of her son William, the financial trustee of the Six Nations. William built the first house, but it was destroyed by the American army in 1813, when its root cellar provided winter refuge for the family of an officer at Fort George.  The house was rebuilt, and William lived there until his death in 1826.  He often received his Indian wards there, who camped by the banks of One-Mile-Creek, which flows through the property.  The present house consists of considerable extensions upon the original 1816-17 construction, and is shielded from view by a forest which includes some extraordinarily tall and broad trees, some of them centuries old.  Claus was a pioneering arborist, who planted the very tall stand of sycamores which line the property on its King Street boundary.  He also introduced soft-fruit cultivation to Niagara, with an orchard of nectarines and peaches;  today, only a single ancient pear tree survives from that orchard. Claus left diaries recording not only the progress of the building, but also the planting of flowers, trees, and vines in the extensive grounds In the 1850’s the property was sold to yet another family prominent in the pioneer annals of Niagara, the Dicksons.  Walter H. Dickson was the only son of Niagara’s richest man, William Dickson, whose magnificent home was burned in 1813 when Walter was seven, and William was away in a prisoner of war camp.  The family fortune began with trade, but grew mightily through land speculation throughout the province, and Walter lived as a lawyer and Conservative politician until his appointment to the first Canadian Senate, in 1867.  After his death in 1885, the property passed out of his family.  In 1919 the property, known as the Wilderness, was bought by W.R. Austin, whose daughter Mrs. Parker became owner in 1925.

The introduction of the jacquard loom in the early 1800s revolutionized weaving by simplifying the production of complex patterns by using punched or cut cards that guided the weaving process. The first use of a jacquard loom in Canada was in 1834, by Wilhelm Armbrust at his shop near Jordan, Ontario. He, like other early weavers, prepared his own patterns and cut the cards for his loom. Due to the complexity of jacquard woven coverlets, the profession became male dominated.

Known as the Fenian Brotherhood, these radicals conducted raids into Canadian territory from 1866 to 1871 and although they had initial success, it would prove short lived. The movement ended in failure and was over by 1871. The only Fenian victory was the initial assault at Ridgeway in 1866, all subsequent actions were failures. Large bodies of British troops and Canadian militia defended the Canadian border and stopped the Fenians before they could gain a foothold in Canada.John Raynor of Niagara-on-the-Lake was one of the many Canadian veterans who were awarded this medal for service in 1870. Raynor had initially volunteered under the 1854 Canadian Militia Act and served in the army after the Trent Affair, when an American vessel captured Confederate diplomats from a British mail packet, creating severe tension between Britain and America during the Civil War. The Trent Affair encouraged Britain to increase the military presence in Canadian territory. Raynor's service throughout all of these incidents reflects a great deal of Canada's experience in the mid- 19th Century. It also illuminates the Canadian involvement in the American Civil War.

He petitioned the government for this land prior to his death, but it had not been issued until after. The fact that this document states that he lived on this property for 10 years is curious since he died approximately 3 years after arriving in Niagara. Following Andrews death, his wife petitioned the government in 1799 to have the deed of the property in her name or have it divided between her children. The province approved this. Her eldest son, Asta, was barred from obtaining any of this property has he had enlisted in the Rangers and then soon after deserted and fled the province. Following the death of her husband, Deborah eventually married Edward Topham. Perhaps this document was forged in an effort for Asta and his descendants to gain access to this land.","property clearingproperty linesGander propertylot 1, concession 8Township of Pelhamgraves"

There were no duplicates of any piece created. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. He dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston and located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr. Bruce Rigg's office and home on King Street.",R.J.R.

He began preaching, but during the early years of Upper Canada, the Church of England was the only recognized church within the province. Within the year,  he started the first Methodist ‘Class' in Canada. During the War of 1812, George Neal left the Niagara area and retired to the 200 acres he was granted in the Port Rowan, Long Point area. As one of Canada's first ""Saddlebag Preacher's"" Neal continued to travel and preach for more than 50 years. In 1908, Rev. E. Garnham, of the Methodist Church in Port Rowan, became interested in Rev. Major George Neal. Rev. Garnham began fundraising for a methodist church in honour of Rev. Major George Neal in Port Rowan.

Emma was inspired to document Laura Secord's story after Sarah Ann Curzon wrote a dramatic play in 1887 titled, Laura Secord: The Heroine of 1812.  She extensively researched her story through reminiscences from Laura's relatives and others who survived the War of 1812. She published The Story of Laura Secord and Canadian Reminiscences in 1900. This publication also included stories of other women from the 1812 period.

It is a detailed record of the expedition led by Colonel Barry St. Leger from Montreal, along the St. Lawrence River, across Lake Ontario and through the Mohawk Valley, where the advance was halted by Fort Stanwix and the Battle of Oriskany before the army could reach Albany. This expedition was made up of British troops, the Kings Royal Regiment of New York under Sir John Johnson, Canadians, German troops, Butler's Rangers, Indian Department officers, and Indian Allies.It was one element of a larger campaign that was planned and led by Brigadier-General John Burgoyne which was intended to sever communications between the northern and southern colonies making it easier for the British to subdue the rebel colonists.The other two elements of the campaign called for Burgoyne's main army to advance southward from Canada following the Lake Champlain-Lake George waterway to reach Albany.The third element of the plan was for Sir William Howe to march north from New York along the Hudson River to prevent American forces from attacking Burgoyne's army from the south.The grand plan failed for several different reasons, one being the failure of Colonel St. Leger's forces to capture Fort Stanwix and his subsequent retreat. While the siege of Fort Stanwix was in progress, St. Leger received word that an American column was approaching from the west under Colonel Nicholas Herchmer, commander of the Tryon County militia. St. Leger immediately sent Loyalist soldiers and 400 Indians under Joseph Brant to ambush Herchmer's column. On 6 August 1777, the ambush was sprung as the column was passing through a gully and the ensuing battle of Oriskany was one of the bloodiest small engagements of the war. The Americans were dispersed and the Loyalist Provincials and Indians won the day, but because of the casualties suffered by the Indians, and the loss of supplies when a detachment of Americans raided their camp, together with St. Leger's failure to capture the fort, the Indians lost patience and left the field forcing the whole expedition to retreat to Oswego and finally to Montreal. Among the documents that were captured when the camp was overrun was Sir John Johnson's Orderly Book, and it has remained in American hands to this day. Meanwhile, Burgoyne's main army on the Hudson suffered huge losses and eventually was forced to surrender at Saratoga on 17 October 1777. Burgoyne's surrender later proved to be the turning point in the war.",Oriskany Campaign Oswego FallsBattle of OriskanyIndian DepartmentButler's Rangers Native AlliesLoyalists

Fanny Doyle briefly assumed her husband's role in the War and loaded cannon balls into the guns at Fort Niagara during a battle against the British.

The library was founded on June 8, 1800 when forty-one prominent Niagara residents met to form a subscription library which they named the Niagara Library.  ""Sensible how much we are at a loss in this new and remote country for every kind of useful knowledge"", the subscribers resolved, ""and convinced that nothing would be of more use to diffuse knowledge amongst us and our offspring, than a library, supported by subscription in this town, we, whose names are hereunto subscribed hereby associate ourselves together for that purpose …."".  Andrew Heron (c.1765-1848), a merchant and land speculator resident in Niagara since 1785 was instrumental in the library's organization.  The library flourished and by late 1812 offered 827 volumes to its subscribers. However, after the American forces withdrew and burned the town on Dec. 13, 1813 only about 200 books remained and the original Niagara Library was forced to cease operations in 1820.

This pedagogic volume, which was designed for use as a school text book, is a somewhat uneven blend of practical instruction for the ""scientific farmer"" which is sprinkled throughout with didactic poetry (""My Cottage Home,"" ""The Farmers' Fair"") and fables. It contains eight chapters filled with practical advice on husbandry and the most up-to-date theories on agricultural production. The first chapter, in the tradition of farming manuals, is a monthly gardener's calendar with ""Brief Hints."" The second chapter deals with ploughing, followed by a chapter on the production of assorted grains, vegetables and root crops. Subsequent chapters form short treatises on animal husbandry, butter and cheese production, new advances in farm mechanization, manure and composting, crop rotation, weed control, and the chemical benefits to be derived from the use of agricultural lime. Not surprisingly, this book does not discuss tender fruit production which, by the 1840s, was not yet economically widespread in the Niagara Peninsula. A second anomaly is the fact that none of the contributors to this volume were from Niagara, but rather were a mixture of the best British and American authorities.  The compiler or editor of this text was the Reverend Thomas Brock Fuller (1810-1884). This volume was donated to the museum by Mrs. Thomas Elliot in May 1896.

Constable William Mollynox presided and Ralfe Clench (later Colonel of the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812) was the clerk.At this, and subsequent meetings, the town officers were appointed: clerk, assessors, collectors, town and church wardens, pound keepers, fence viewers and overseers of highways.  The meetings were held yearly, in March, and were presided over by the constable. The bylaws passed at the first meeting, and reaffirmed at the following meetings, were few: ""Hogs cannot be allowed to run at large"" or ""the height of fences should be five feet to be lawful.""  In 1808, carriage drivers were directed to ""give half the road and keep to the right hand side"". However, there is no record of meetings being held from 1814 to 1816. Initially the town was called Newark but by 1800 the town is referred to as Niagara.   A Board of Commissioners devised a division of labour for Township duties. Men 21 years and up had to give two days work per year. The last two pages also contain a register of marks used by farmers to identify their hogs and cattle. These lists of officers, labourers and farmers provide a valuable resource for researchers.

The next year on the Mississauga Common a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890's golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first international Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course has never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long, a score card states that it is a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks.

Janet Carnochan was chosen as the Niagara Historical Society President, much to her surprise and reluctance, and she served as Society President for 30 years. Under her guidance the organization built up a collection of artifacts, starting in 1896, related to this historic town and the Niagara Peninsula. She even had the forethought to commission a local artist to produce paintings of the town which now show buildings that no longer exist. Many of the Museum's most prized possessions arrived under her leadership. The current Memorial Hall, owned by the Society, is the first purpose-built museum in Ontario, and was erected largely due to Janet's efforts.

Blake in partition proceedings brought by Agnes McFarland regarding Lot #52. Transcription is as follows:Ontario Country of YorkIn the matter of lot Number 52 in the Town of Niagara on the Lake in the County of Lincoln.To wit:I, James Richardson Roaf in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, Solicitor, do Solemnly declare:(1) That I acted as solicitor for the Defendants John A. Blake and Gertrude L. Blake in the partition proceedings brought by one Agnes McFarland for the sale or partition of the above mentioned lot and in teh course of the said proceedings I had to make enquiries about the family of the said John A. Blake and the said Agnes McFarland and the different interests in connection with the said property.(2) I found that John Rogers and Mary Rogers subsequently Mary Blake, were brother and sister and that the name of their mother was Agnes Rogers and I believe that the said M. Blake the grantor in the deed of Bargain and sale dated the 4th of December 1835 was the same person as Mary Rogers the grantee in the patent dated the 15th of July 1830.(3) That the said John Rogers was an unmarried man until he was comparatively well on in the years when he married, his wife also being an Agnes Rogers and the said John Rogers when he deceased died interstate leaving him surviving his widow Eliza Ann Rogers and one child Ada Rogers the said John Rogers not having married until the later part of the 19th century and somewhere about the year 1875.(4) That the said property was apparently divided into two parcels (a) On the corner a small portion about 1/7 of an acre upon which was erected two stone stores. (b) The remainder of the said lot upon which was erected a dwelling house which together with the garden surrounded the portion (a) The said dwelling house was occupied by the said Agnes Rogers, mother of John Rogers, and with her lived her son John Rogers and her daughter Mary Blake who had become a widow, and John A. Blake and Agnes McFarland two chuldren of the said Mary Blake. On or about December the 24th 1835 the whole of the said property became vested in the said John Rogers who on the 25th day of January 1836 made a mortgage of the residence and a portion of the said property being parcel (b) above mentioned, to this mother Agnes Rogers to secure an annuity of 25 pounds a year.(5) The said Agnes Rogers subsequently died leaving a will bearing date on or about the 2nd day of April 1862, which will was duly probated and subsequently registered in the registry office of the county of Lincoln as number 12624 whereb shedivised the property for life to her daughter Mary Ann Blake (the above called Mary Blake) with remainder equally between the said Mary Ann Blake, Agnes McFarland and John A. Blake they being the daughter and two of the grandchildren of the said Agnes Rogers. The said Mary Ann Blake subsequently died leaving a will bearing date the 18th of May 1894 whereby she devised all her interest in the said property to her daughter Agnes McFarland who thereupon would be entitled to 2/3 interest or share in the whole property and brought petition proceedings for sale of the said property.(6) In the said proceedings I raised the question that a mortgage having been made by John Rogers to his Mother Agnes Rogers of about 2/3 of the said lot that the deed of quit claim bearing date Sugust 11th 1857 made by the said John Rogers to the said Agnes Rogers a title to the portion of the lands which had not been mortgaged to her and that the said John Rogers or his representative the same being his widow Agnes Rogers and his daughter Ada Rogers might be entitled to a portion of the said property. The said partition proceeding came on for trial at St. Catharines on the 29th day of May 1899 and the Judge the Honourable W.R. Merredith reserved Judgment and after considering the matter and by consent the said Agnes Rogers the widow and Ada Rogers the only daughter of the said John Rogers were added as parties to the said partition proceedings and the proceedings were subsequently continued and in time a sale of the said property was made to Herbert R. Blake and by vesting order made on or about the 4th of July 1902, the interest of Agnes McFarland, John A. Blake, Gertrude L. Blake, to whom the said John A. Blake had conveyed his interest, Agnes Rogers and Ada Rogers were vested in the said H.R. Blake.(7) I also found that the said Blake family and their mother Agnes Rogers and John Rogers had been continually in possession of the said property since about the year 1835 and that no claim could be found adverse to them though the said John Rogers and Mary Ann Blake had given some mortgages which had been held by the Niagara District Building Society but that the said mortgages had been handed over to the said Mary Ann Blake and the same had been paid off and no claim had been made or could be made against the interest of the said parties to teh said partition proceedings.AND I make this solemn Delcaration conscientiously believing it to be true, and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath by the virtue of ""The Canada Evidence Act, 1893.""Declared before me at the City of Toronto in the County of York this first day of February A.D. 1904(no name signed)A Commissioner &c.",Lot 52Niagara-on-the-LakeLincoln County

Antoni was one of several Polish Falcon instructors who attended Camp Kosciusko.Antoni Wiacek was born to a peasant family on January 11, 1889, in the Austrian-controlled part of Poland. In 1912, he emigrated to the United States, where he settled in New York and became a member of the Polish Falcons Alliance of America. He completed the Falcons' instructor course in Philadelphia, which was designed to create a corps of military instructors to train future officers for a Polish Army.  Wiacek was part of the inaugural Polish Officers' School of Infantry class at the University of Toronto and upon completion, he graduated as a Lieutenant. Antoni was given a position at the Polish Army Recruitment office in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the summer of 1918, he joined the Firs Rifle Regiment of the Polish Army in France. In the spring of 1919, Wiacek was transferred to Poland to take part in the Polish-Soviet War, where he was put in command of his own company. In May of 1920, Antoni was shot in battle near Lipowca-Napodowski. Even though he was injured he carried on leading his company. Among the Regiment Officers, his actions were regarded with the highest honour.  He would go on to repeat these actions again in battle near Rowne, where he was seriously wounded. After being discharged from the army, he was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari, Croix de Guerre and the Cross of Valour (three times). After the war, Wiacek stayed in Poland to help his country regain its independence. Sadly, Antoni was executed in what has become known as the Katyn Forest Crime, where 15,000 Polish Army officers were executed by the Soviet Army during World War II.",First World WarWWIPolish SoldiersCamp KosciuszkoNiagara CampPolish Falcons Association of America

The property was previously owned by:Daniel Servos, until 1803John D Servos, until 1847Peter C Servos, until 1879; andMary Servos, until 1905The property was continued to be owned by Mary’s daughter until the 1940s. Daniel Servos, a Butler's Ranger, built the family homestead in 1783 near Four Mile Creek and Lakeshore Road. On the property he also built a grist mill and tannery, and operated a Trading Post for the early settlers of Niagara. Upon Daniel’s death in 1803, his son, John took over the operation of the mills and farmed the property until his death. Peter, who married Mary Ball,  owned the family homestead until the couples divorce, when the property was transferred to Mary. Life was not easy for Mary from this point on. She raised their four children while also continuing the management of the farm. The day to day work was left to hired workers, but she managed all her own affairs, lived on her own means and owned all the stock and chattels on the farm. When Mary wasn’t managing the affairs of the farm or her children, she turned one of the rooms  in the home into a Museum and displayed family documents and artefacts that were associated with members of the Servos family. This laid the ground work for her daughter, Mary Elizabeth Olivia Josephine Servos Snider, to further develop the family’s historical roots. Additionally, under her tutelage, the homestead acquired the name ""Palatine Hill"".

The sketch was donated to the museum by Mary Ann Guillen, Mr. Riley's daughter, who was Janet Carnochan's major source of information about the town's 19th century black community.  The drawing was done for Mrs. Guillen by a female acquaintance, shortly before the squared timber building was pulled down in the 1880's. William Riley, an escaped slave from Fredericksburg, Virginia, bought the one acre town lot, 276, at the corner of Mary and Victoria streets, from William Dickson for £50 in 1819, becoming the third black man to own property in the village.  The price was fair for land in the area.  However, one does wonder why Mr. Dickson paid only five shillings for it a short time earlier. Neither transaction was registered until 1886.  Mr. Riley built the house in 1819, a year after his marriage at Lake Lodge (the home of Rev. Robert Addison), to Rev. Addison's German servant Fanny.  By 1851, eight family members lived in the house: William, Fanny (a. 57), their children Mary Ann (27), Fanny (20), Edward (18) and three grandchildren, William (11), Fanny (3) and Edward (1). After Riley's death in 1860, Edward and his sisters inherited lot 276.  The last family member to own the land was William's granddaughter, Fanny Rowley, who also owned 177 King and 143 King Street, and the Rowley Block on Queen Street.

Commanders ordered soldiers to dig trenches to hold ground, and charge the enemy head on in order to advance. Facing newly developed machine guns, fighter planes and tanks, this policy led to an unprecedented number of casualties for both sides. In the spring of 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, allied soldiers would be introduced to yet another technological development: Chlorine Gas. At 5:00PM on April 22nd 1915, German troops released Chlorine gas on the French 45th Algerian Division, positioned to the left of the Canadian line at Ypres. While most of the gas missed the Canadians, the French retreat created a large gap in the defensive line that had to be filled by the outnumbered Canadians. Fighting to hold the position, the Canadians faced a direct Chlorine Gas attack two days later. Though the Canadians were able to hold the position until reinforcements arrived, the battle cost the lives of 6,000 Canadians in their first major engagement of the war. It was in this environment that the first gas masks were produced.The threat of poison gas remained, and different methods of protecting soldiers from Chemical warfare were developed. Featured here is a German Lederschutzmaske from 1917. It is composed of an all-leather face piece, glass lenses, and rubber and cloth straps which run along the back to ensure a secure fit. The chemical filter is directly attached, differentiating it from the Allied 'small box respirator' style of mask in which the filter was carried in a satchel, worn on the back and away from the face.  The German design made the mask less cumbersome, but it was known to reduce the soldier's ability to fire his weapon accurately.  Respirators on the mask were also known to wear out faster than their Allied counterparts, and the leather sections, used due to economic shortages, often failed under high concentrations of gas.     Although details of this mask's journey are unknown, it is likely that it made its way to Canada as part of a collection of war souvenirs. Trophies of the conflict were in great demand, with soldiers searching for weapons, clothing and equipment, to bring back as mementos of their actions overseas. Nearly 100 years later, souvenirs such as this one still serve as solemn reminders of the sacrifices that were made and of the challenges that Canadian soldiers faced during the conflict.",First World WarGreat WarWWIMilitary

There are two members of the Hamilton family who were noteworthy in the early history of Queenston.Robert Hamilton (1753-1809). Born in Scotland, arrived in Montreal 1779 as an apprentice clerk in the fur trade and forwarding company. In 1780 he formed a firm to provide supplies to the military, Indian Department and settlers. Hamilton was in charge at Niagara. He became a major land speculator and was at one point the largest landowner in the Niagara Penninsula.  He also served the Legislative Council, was Justice of the Peace, and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He became the most influencial private citizen in Upper Canada prior to the War of 1812.Alexander Hamilton (1790-1839). Attended school at Queenston, Niagara and Scotland. He worked for a short time in his father's business. Upon the death of his father the business was transfered to Alexander and his brother George. Due to the changing economic circumstances in Upper Canada and the brothers' business inexperience their business declined. During the War of 1812 he was present in many of the major engagements in Niagara. After the war he transfered his interest from business to government posts. He received a commission as Justice of the Peace, Postmaster, deputy collector of customs at Queenston, surrogate court Judge and Sherriff of Niagara District. In 1833 funds were sufficient that he was able to build the mansion Willowbank in Queenston.",QueenstonWillowbank

After being in business for a few years in Dundas, he moved to the village of Queenston in Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1823. Here he became known as a bookseller, grocer, haberdasher, and druggist. Records don't seem to indicate what piqued his interest in politics or the desire to start his newspaper, The Colonial Advocate, but in 1824 he launched his first issue from his home and business in Queenston. The Colonial Advocate was dedicated to political and social reform and promoted responsible government and opposition to the current colonial governing practices that ruled Upper Canada at the time. Mackenzie had been editing his newspaper in the village for about three months, when he decided to lure Hiram Leavenworth, along with his press, printing materials, and typeset to Queenston, to manage the printing on his behalf. Before this, Mackenzie had his bi-weekly paper printed in Lewiston. This document is an agreement between Leavenworth and Mackenzie for the duties, salary, and equipment purchased to begin his Queenston operation.  Within one month, Mackenzie's print shop was in full operation in his home, located at 1 Queenston Street. After producing around 20 issues, Mackenzie left Queenston for York (Toronto) in the fall of 1824, and he continued printing his newspaper there. This move was ultimately made from his desire to make a difference politically-and did he ever! He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, but he caused so many issues that he was kicked and elected back in four times! In 1834, the Reformers won a majority on the newly created Toronto City Council, and Mackenzie was elected Toronto's first Mayor. When he was defeated at the polls in 1836, he became very resentful. This is when he began planning the Upper Canada Rebellion, which took place in December of 1837.  This rebellion was put down quite quickly, due to poor planning and lack of military experience from the individuals involved. Since his involvement in this insurrection was considered treasonous, there was a warrant out for his capture and arrest. Mackenzie fled from Toronto to the United States. He tried to continue to lead his rebellion from Navy Island located on the Niagara River. Here he organized his own provisional government, and he was able to obtain money and weapons from supporters and sympathizers. The British Military wasn't going to let him off easy. They bombarded Navy Island with cannon fire. Eventually, he and his supporters abandoned the island. Despite the failed rebellion in 1837, Mackenzie was able to spark a flame in many who believed in his democratic ideals. His newspaper, The Colonial Advocate, which started in Queenston, was part of this movement and it helped to sew the seeds of rebellion.",

Memorial Hall, is Ontario’s first purpose-built Museum and as built largely due to the efforts of Janet Carnochan, the Niagara Historical Society’s first President. When the Society began collecting artefacts of significant interest, several people doubted the Society’s ability, believing that everything had been given away or destroyed, or that no one would either give or lend anything for such a purpose. Fortunately, the Society ignored these sentiments. The early collection produced artefacts of both local and national interest, many of which are still preserved by the society’s Museum. The society was always searching for a way to memorialize the United Empire Loyalists who settled in Niagara. In 1898, the notion that this memorial could take the form of a building to house the society’s collection was first introduced. By 1903, with the collection at over 2,000 items, the society began planning the construction of this building. It would be called Memorial Hall.Janet spearheaded the fundraising campaign and the society managed to successfully raise ($4,924.78) 95% of the costs, only managing to borrow $275 from the bank, which was paid off 2 years later. On June 4, 1907 the Society opened the first purpose-built museum in Ontario, which to this day is still apart of the Museum complex.",

He was the 3rd son of Darius and Rebecca Williams, of ‘Welch’ descent.  Benajah settled on 100 acres in Niagara in 1795, with an additional 100 acres added in 1796. I presume these were the tracts described in the land grant?   Subsequently in 1805 he moved to Glen Williams where he established a mill in the Credit river. The Stamford survey of 1813, which must have been a hazardous survey given the war in Niagara that year, shows that he owned only 1 of the 2 acreages at that time. Benajah was married three times and had 9 children.  He died in Glen Williams in 1851.  His family continues to own the mill until late in the 1800’s when it was sold to the Beaumonts.Transcript reads: ""GEORGE the THIRD by the Grace of GOD, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.

In both cases it was whiskey that was purchased.  Also of note is that on May 18, a quart of whiskey was picked up at the still house.  This tells us that Chisholm owned, or at least had interest in a still in Niagara.  Stills were shut down in 1814 because the grain used in the distillation was required for flour to feed the troops and First Nations allies and families.Another Interesting Note on this Receipt:This receipt was written on paper that was manufactured for the British Military and should not have been used for non-government purposes.  Chisholm, as a militia officer, had access to this paper.  Paper was expensive and actually in short supply during the War of 1812.  It is interesting to note that Chisholm, against regulations and a risk of censure, used at least one sheet for his own business.",War of 1812Lincoln MilitiaWhiskey

Adam Crooks to Mr. Milloy dated 22nd March 1888.You will observe that in the first deed dated 17th of June 1879 there is no mention of Collingwood St, nor is Collingwood Street designed on the plan of the Dock Company's property, we take it that this street is the one laid out by Meneilly referred to in your letter as a right of way. There is no registered plan showing Collingwood St. The only thing from which the Conveyancer who made the description in the Milloy Deed could get to a street of that name is an Atlas of the Counties of Lincoln and Welland.By H.B. Page(page 2)Which was gather up in 1876 but which apparently is not very authentic in fact it is a very unreliable book in regard to places generallyIt purports to be based on the most reliable information but it certainly fails to give correct information in regard to any plan and description we now enclose, you will be to make out what are -ights respectively of Meneilly and Milloy in regard to land covered by what is designated Collingwood St.Mr. Currie the Registrar who know this property well for years past, and who camped with the local battalion not far from it, and traversed every foot of it for years back, says that the fence you refer to can only have been built a very few years, certainly not long enough to bar Mr Meneilly under the statute. We have not been able to get any other information but should you desire it we could perhaps learn something from inquiries of residents of the old Town.

In this letter, Clark reports that when Captain Nelles' company of the 4th Lincoln was called out for active service at Fort George he showed up with only 7 men, claiming that the remainder of his company were cutting timber for the government elsewhere.   Clark was upset by this when he expected a full company of around 50 men to report for duty at Fort George and in effect threatened Major Ten Broeck. It was important to have the militia work on the fortifications at Fort George and new Fort Mississauga then under construction.  Getting these places into a defensible shape was crucial, as was proven in July when the Americans invaded yet again and marched to the Town of Niagara following their victory at the Battle of Chippawa.  The forts were sufficiently strong to prevent the Americans from attacking and recapturing Niagara.Clark wrote that ""in future two companys (sic) will be required to serve for Seven days.""  He then stated that if more men did not readily respond when called out for duty then ""we will call for the whole Regiment and keep them out until the service required is performed.""  This goad undoubtedly spurred Ten Broeck to ensure that sufficient ""volunteers"" answered the call when required to prevent the whole regiment, every man between the ages of 16 to 60, from being forced to serve.Throughout the War of 1812, companies of normally around 50 militia men from the various regiments were called out by the British for active service for labour, to serve on guard duty, to transport supplies by wagon or bateau, to man sentry stations and, in dire emergencies, to fight alongside the British Regulars.  Normally, these companies of men would be called out for relatively brief periods of time, a week or two normally, and would be relieved by another company.  This ensured that the work was done while enabling the sedentary militia to carry on with their regular civilian pursuits.  The provision of livestock and produce throughout the war was essential for feeding the troops on duty and the Native allies and their families.",War of 1812War of 1812-14Lincoln Militia4th Lincoln Militia

Ten Broeck was instructed to ""make known to the officers non Commissioned Officers & Privates"" of the 4th Lincoln the contents of the District Order. This is 3 weeks before the Battle of Fort George.  The District Order referred to has not yet been located.  However, news of the Capture of York on April 27th had reached Fort George at 1:00 a.m. on April 29 and it is suspected that this District Order was related to that event.  Brigadier General John Vincent, in command at Fort George, expected the next American move to be an attack on the Head of the Lake to secure the position at Burlington Heights, thereby threatening British communications with the Grand River by cutting the overland route from Burlington Bay to the interior.  He expected that the Americans would then attack Fort George in a pincer movement across the Niagara River and from the Burlington vicinity.  Following the American capture of York, many of the militiamen of York District had sought out the Americans to offer their ""paroles,"" promises to not fight against the Americans in exchange for their freedom to go about their civilian activities unhindered.  The District Order sent to Ten Broeck may have been to remind the Lincoln Militia of their duty and to warn them to be prepared to be called up, pending further American action.Transcript is ""Fort George 2nd May 1813   Sir  I have the honor to enclose for you information a copy of the Militia D.

It was written from the military headquarters at 4 Mile Creek on September 17th (or 19th), 1813.   Shaw was requesting that Ten Broeck's company rendez-vous at the head quarters.  During this time, the Americans were occupying Niagara(Niagara-on-the-Lake) and Fort George.

Addressed ""On Service Major Tenbroeck Commanding 4th Regt. Lincoln AE.S. 12 Mile Creek""Following the American capture of Fort George on May 27, 1813, the British retreated to Burlington Heights.  Shortly thereafter, a delaying action on June 6 at Stoney Creek prevented the Americans from attacking the British position at Burlington Heights.  The timely arrival of the British fleet with supplies and reinforcements, and the ambush of the Americans at the Battle of Stoney Creek, caused the Americans to withdraw back to the safety of Fort George.  On the way back, an American encampment was attacked by the ships of the Royal Navy at the 40 Mile Creek (Grimsby) on June 7.   As the Americans retreated to Fort George they were followed by a force of British regulars, Canadian Militia and First Nations allies who subsequently set up a loose siege of Fort George, with encampments on the Four Mile Creek, 12 Mile Creek and the Short Hills.   An American attempt to cut off a British piquet (outpost) at Decew's House on the approach to  the Short Hills (Thorold) was defeated at the Battle of Beaver Dams on June 24, primarily by First Nations allies from and Seven Nations of Canada from the Province of Lower Canada.  The Americans had failed in an attempt to force the British to withdraw to the 40 Mile Creek.  For the rest of the summer, the Americans were kept bottled up in Fort George and within a one mile radius of the fort.  The British continued to harass American sentry positions and ambush American foraging parties that left the confines of their fortified camp.Because the militiamen helping the British were largely from the agricultural community, it was necessary for the British to rotate the men on active duty during planting and harvest seasons to allow the farmers to get home to plant or harvest their crops.  Regiments of militia were rotated, allowed to return to their farms in shifts.  The British relied on local produce to feed their troops, the warriors of First Nations allies fighting alongside them, and the families of those warriors.In this letter from Major General Aeneas Shaw, Adjutant General of the Militia, to Major Jacob Ten Broeck of the 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia was ordered to muster his regiment for active duty. Major Ten Broeck was in command of the 4th Lincoln following the death of Lieutenant-colonel Johnson Butler on December 1, 1812.  The 4th Lincoln consisted of all men of military age (16 to 60), primarily from Clinton and Grimsby Townships. The men of the 4th Lincoln were to report to the British Headquarters at the Four Mile Creek (Virgil) to join in the siege of Fort George.  After a brief period in the British encampment providing sentries, cutting wood and assembling supplies for the army, they were relieved by another regiment of Lincoln Militia and permitted to return to their farms to carry on with the harvest.",Lincoln MilitiaFour Mile CreekVirgilMusterAmerican OccupationWar of 1812

When the proceedings were commenced I understood from your father that he was willing to have $700 or $800 paid to get rid of Mrs. McFarland's claim. The result is you have paid $860 for the property, the family have lived on the property for the last three years and out of the purchase money you are allowed $36.96 for taxes and Mrs. McFarland has paid $74 for taxes, making $110.96 taxes paid out of the purchase money; Miss Gertrude gets back $154.19, making $265, which set off against the $860 leaves under $600 as the price of the property and you have saved the interest for three years. Mrs. McFarland obtains repayment of $74 taxes paid by her and $308.57 for herself, so that she would ahve been far better off if she agreed to make a settlement at the beginning, she would certainly have received more than the $300 for her own use.I have been allowed out of the proceeds of sale $41.00 for fees and the disbursements and fillings paid by me. I enclose you a memorandum of an account, which I do not think exorbitant, for getting the sale put through and getting the deed to you. Mr. Greer gets about $60.00 commission and then also $100 out of the share that was set apart in which the Rogers family were interested. He has certainly not done double the work that I have in the matter so I do not think it would be out of the way to ask you to have you remit me Thirty dollars in connection with the fees of the suit in addition to the fees connected with the purchase of the property. I will state plainly that I would not want to have very many lawsuits in my office to be conducted with as little recompense as this will make in this matter, but I wish to take into account the circumstances connected with the whole transaction and with the position of the family.

It was written during his journeys to the Canadian and American West. (1864-65). Topics discussed in the letter include:Blake writes of his concern for his uncle John's cough.  He says John should visit him as the is a pure water establishment, ""something like the Stevenson House"".  Blake mentions his children, Herb and Ada.  He talks of the extreme hot weather, 104 in the shade at the time of writing.  Blake writes about unloading self loading rifles sent by Clark(?) from Washington.  These rifles shoot 16 times without taking them from the shoulder.  They are as accurate as those used in Canada and much handsomer.  Blake saw a large lot of Buffalo skins come in from the praries and he wished he'd been among them with one of those riles.He writes of Mrs. Cittenden and family enjoying their visit to the farm.  He is sorry that Deal Smith is in poor health and says that she should be taking lots of ale and porter.  He writes that he is pleased that the stone has been put up but wishes he knew what the freight and charges were.  (Assume this stone is for Blake's first wife, Gertrude who died in 1863)He mentions that he does not know why his uncle Sam Stocking has visited his mother and children again.  Blake writes about the place he is in that, the only thing to do is buy land and raise stock.  Blake is concerned that Sam Stocking should ""sell the milk so I can get my money"".  Blake writes that he needs the money so he can send some to his mother to buy shoes for Mary.  He suggests that the shoes be bought at Welsh's on credit.  Clark has arrived and Blake and Clark will be starting out very soon.  He says that his mother should write to him every week and it will be forwarded to him.  Blake says that he will not have any chance to write to her.  Blake tells his mother that he does not intend to go into the army.  Blake says that Aunt Sally says Aunt Liddy's cancer is better.  Aunt Sally wants Uncle John to come to Roscoe.  He can go from Buffalo to Chicago on a steam boat for $9.00 U.S. and from there to Roscoe for 2 or 3 dollars.  Blake talks of Clark getting the Rail Road going and if it succeeds it will open up a large tract of country.  He then writes about how expensive everything is, as compared to Buffalo.  He writes about his children's health.  He asks that his uncle give his regards to Henderson and Milloy.  He then talks about the deer and prairie chickens that are so plentiful for shooting. He says he could fill the whole of Niagara with deer and chickens by himself.  He complains that he is not getting replies to his letters.  He asks that Agg take good care of Phils (his dog).  He says the dog would be of great value to min and if he came again he would bring him even if it cost $100.00.  Prices for dogs are #50 - $100 and they sell quickly.",American West

He was also the respected and trusted lawyer for the Six Nations. For the services he rendered, the Six Nations had surrendered to him in March 1809, a block of approximately 4,000 acres at the mouth of the Grand River in Sherbrooke Township. This block was adjacent to Block 5, some 30,500 acres, that was originally purchased by William Jarvis, Jarvis was short of funds and so he gave up his claim. Block 5 was eventually purchased by Thomas Douglas, the Rt. Honourable, The Earl of Selkirk (1771-1820). He was a 'colonization philanthropist' who purchased several properties for proposed settlement by displaced Scot Highlanders and poor Irish peasants. Selkirk paid £3,850 for this Block, but he took out a mortgage for £3,485 held by the Six Nations. To enlarge the size of his grant he also purchased Dickson's adjacent grant of 4,000 acres. Selkirk never made any of the mortgage payments and the colony lapsed undeveloped. When Selkirk died in 1820, he was bankrupt, and the full mortgage was still outstanding. Dickson, who had never been anxious to sell to Selkirk in the first place, purchased the tract back from the Selkirk estate. This is what makes up the prime subject matter of this letter. The letter is also significant for the background information given: 'The Emperor' referred to is William Lyon Mackenzie who had recently arrived in Upper Canada and was already creating 'mischief'.

Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe had proclaimed in 1793 that the members of the Six Nations did not hold title to the land (the Haldimand Track) and could not as individuals sell their land without permission of the Crown. Joseph Brant and many Chiefs took exception to this. Several Blocks were sold to outsiders by Joseph Brant on reluctant agreement of Peter Russell, Administrator of the government of Upper Canada, in 1797. Brant was eventually forbidden to sell more lands, but he had partially gotten around this by issuing 999-year leases. When Brant died in 1807, the majority of the Haldimand Tract was still in Six Nation's hands.  In 1820-21, John Brant and Robert Johnson Kerr tried to get permission to sell their lands without Government approval. The Imperial Government (presumably the ""Secretary of the State for the Colonies"") granted them this opportunity only if the Council of Six Nations unanimously agreed.  The colonial officials in Upper Canada and William Claus were shocked that this was granted. The speech that is being referenced in this letter occurred when Claus addressed the Council of Chiefs in August 1822, at which time he warned the chiefs that if they were to sell their lands as freeholders, they would no longer receive the annual 'King's Bounty', and like all enfranchised male citizens in the province, they would be required to serve in the militia, pay taxes, and maintain the roads/bridges in their community.

This title seems to start in the yer 1864, according to registered abstract and preceeding the same is a note ""no further instruments on title registered"". On the 20th January, 1881, Probate of the last will and testament of Thomas Dick was registered as GR237, which will was dated 14th September, 1874, and by it the late Thomas Dick conveyed to his beloved adopted daughter, Agnes Dick, all his real estate and by clause three thereof he inserted a wish that if she had not disposed of the real estate during her lifetime that she should will the whole or what part thereof remained to such one or more of the following,- Christina McGaw, Williamina Gordon and Christina Gordon or heirs or the children of my half brother, James Dick and by clause 4 of the said will he gave her full power of alienation without restrictions by deed. Evidently this was the cause of a suit for a certificate of Judgement #2276, dated the 5th of June, 1894 and registered on the 14th of June, 1894, in which Thomas McGaw was Plaintiff as Executor of the estate of Agnes Dick and William C. Dick and for whom from their description would be Christina McGaw, Williamina Gordon, Christina Gordon and their heirs and the children of the half brother, James Dick were the Defendents and a Declaration was given by the Court declaring Agnes Dick to have full and unfettered power of alienation by deed or will and in such matter and extent to such persons as she might see fit. The said Agnes Dick made her last will and testament dated the 21st of January, 1889, which was registered on the 20th September, 1894, in which she appointed as Executor, Thomas McGaw, and Probate of which she said last Will and testament was registered GR 618 and the real estate was divided to the Executor in trust ""to lease the same until sold at the expiration of five years from the date hereof or soon thereafter as they can do so without loss to my estate in whole or in part, or from time to time,"" and the income from said estate while so held was to be divided among certain persons named therein, The two other executors named in the last will renounced. Instrument #245 B.and S., dated the 1st of January, 1896, registered the 2nd of April, 1896, Thomas McGaw as Executor conveyed to William Ramsey, the consideration being $129.180., the Queen's Hotel property at Niagara-on-the-Lake and other lands in the City of Toronto which Deed contained the usual statutory covenants and by Deed bearing even date therewith and registered on teh same date but which affidavit of execution shows to have been sworn to by the witness in Scotland on the 18th of January of the same year which instrument is #2452 William Ramsey conveyed to Thomas McGaw, the consideration being $129, 180, the same lands as contained in instrument #2451, which deed contained the usual statutory covenants but there is no reference therein as to whether or not the said William Ramsey, who at that time was described as a resident of Scotland and formerly of the City of Toronto was an unmarried man or a widower. There is no bar of dower. By instrument #2454, dated the 19th of March, 1896 and registered on the 2nd of April, 1896, Thomas McGaw and wife conveyed to Henry Winnett one-half undivided moiety or half share, and interest in consideration of the sum of $20,000, to the Queen's Royal Hotel property and which deed contains the covenant, which is evidently worrying you; ""And each of the parties hereto in consideration of the premises doth hereby for himself, his executors and administrators covenant with the other of them his executors and administrators, that so long as the said parties hereto shall continue to be tenants of the Queen's Hoel, Toronto, he will not sell or dispose or convey his moiety, half share and interest in the said lands, premises and chattels to any person or persons whatsoever"". By Instrument #2955, Henry Winnett and wife and others as executors of Thomas McGaw convey to James Murphy, the hotel property, except two cottages in consideration of the sum of $30,00, which deed contains the usual statutory covenants and was dated the 1st. of March, 1902, registered on the 18th March, 1902. Instrument #2956, which instrument was registered on the 14th March, 1902, James Murphy, Bachelor, in consideration of the sum of One Dollar conveyed the land described in instrument number #2955. There is no seal after the signature on this Deed. A Partition Deed, #3124 refers to two cottages known as the McGaw Cottage and the Winnett Cottage, which were respectfully conveyed tto the said Henry Winnett and the said Williamina McGaw, reserving a right-of-way for sewer from the Hotel Property to the Niagara River. Again on teh 10th of March, 1902, by deed #3125, which was registered on teh 19th March, 1904, the above refered to James Murphy, a bachelor, conveyed to Henry Winnett the lands in instrument #2955, which deed contained the usual statutory covenants. Instrument #4134 was produced byut it was found to pertain only to the cottages referred to in Instrument 3124. Instrument #4906 was an Option dated the 19th July 1919, and registered on the 22nd, September 1919, from Henry Winnett to Major W.F.N. Windeyer, of Toronto, which Option was for 90 days, purchase price $30,000.00 cash for the purchase of the Hotel property and contained a clause that if the said Major Windeyer within the said 90 days had a party of te purchase of the said property that a further extention of 30 days would be allowed.

However, we understand that in the past the hotel management has not co-operated as freely as it might have done in the employment of help and also in regard to the purchase of supplies in the community. We wish to point out that we now have in our employment and actually woking at the Queens 25 men and women, all of whom are from Niagara. We wish also to point out the fact that all supplies neccessary for beginning our work and for preparing the hotel for service have been purchased in the town of Niagara. It is our intention to continue this policy in so far as it is consitent with the economical management of the hotel. I might also state that it is our intention to carry out said policy to the extent to which the community responds and cooperates.Now therefore, in your consideration on all of the above, we respectfully petition that your grant us, Queens Royal Hotel Limited free water for the year 1925. Feeling that if such a petition is granted that we will be benefitted and that in return we will be able to help the community greatly.Yours truly,Queens Royal Hotel Limited(no name)President""Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara.  The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines.  It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake.  This was one of the finest hotels in North America.  The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism.  Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927.  The building was demolished in 1930.  An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished.  In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity.  A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",Niagara-on-the-LakeQueens Royal HotelTown CouncilTourism Water Bill

https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/019/9895307.jpg,Letter,989.5.307,1812-MAY.28,"Augusta McCormick was the daughter of William Jarvis, provincial secretary and registrar to the Executive Council of Upper Canada. When the capital of Upper Canada was established in Newark (today Niagara-on-the-Lake), Augusta settled here with her family. It was in Niagara where she met her husband, Thomas McCormick. Augusta and Thomas lived in Queenston (1812-1821) and when Thomas was appointed as the manager of the Bank of Upper Canada, they moved to what is today known as Niagara-on-the-Lake. While not much is known about Augusta, we can assume that she lived a life of wealth and leisure based on her father and husband’s prominent positions within the Niagara community, and from the evidence contained within this letter. In this preserved letter, Augusta writes to her father from her home in Queenston. The letter is dated May 28, 1812 and it details what her life  was like just before the outbreak of the War of 1812. Augusta talks about some of the domestic duties she is responsible for, which include her housekeeper and garden. She also sends along local news to her father about the birth of her sisters (Hannah Owens Hamilton) son, Robert Jarvis Hamilton, Mr. Dickson’s health, and that her sister, Eliza (Jarvis) Robison, has sent along cake from Queenston to their father in York (Toronto). Augusta’s letter also indicates that her world is not completely shunned from the rumbles of war brewing. She lets on in this letter that Major-General Brock had arrived in Queenston and that her brother William Munson Jarvis has received a military commission. While it may seem like a simple letter, the information contained within give us a glimpse into what life was like for a middle to upper class woman in Niagara, especially so close to the outbreak of war. The community of Queenston was devastated in just 5 months, when the Battle of Queenston Heights destroyed much of the community.

The original bears the stamp of ""Ship Letter"" per ""Mary"".St. Davids, July 4, 1813My dear Aunt,Your last kind letter of the first April, together with the large packet from the boys, came to hand last evening and gave us infinite pleasure. I can easily conceive how anxious you must be to hear from this as such a time, but I assure you that it is almost impossible either to write or to get letters from this when written: this must in some measure excuse our long silence. Many changes of fortune have occured since the commencement of the war, but we are still, thank God, able to keep our heads up, and things at this moment appear again in our favour. The first appearances were rather against us; General Hull of the Americans, crossed the river at Detroit and planted their standard, but short was their triumph. Our gallant General Brock attacked them with a handful of troops, drove them from their entrenchments, and in our turn crossed the river, took possesion of Fort Detroit, when the whole garrison - 2,500 men - as also the territory of Michigan, surrendered to our arms. Brock returned amidst the acclamations of an almost idolizing public.Their next attempt was at Fort Erie. From the great extent of our lines of defence, from Fort Erie to Niagara - 35 miles - with scarcely 1000 regular troops, you may suppose how weak our Guards were. They attacked us in the middle of the night with 500 picked men, sailors, and I am sorry to say most of them our own countrymen, surrounded our small guards and murdered them without mercy, and took possession of three of our batteries - but again their reign was short. Day dawned - the remainder of our small collected and drove them with precipitations into their boats, and took their commander officer and fifty men. This was nothing - our danger only now appeared approaching. An incredible number of boats were drawn up along the opposing shore, the troops all embarked - 5000 men. A few well directed shots from our field pieces, and the alacrity of our re-enforcements, coming in every minute, made them first pause and at last entirely relinquish their plan. Their troops were disembarked and their boats taken as far as possible out of he range of our shots. The business of Queenston you already know; they were again defeated with astonishing loss - one General, two or three Cols., 50 or 60 inferior Officers and 1000 men. General Winchester next fell into our hands in approaching Fort Detroit with 450 men. The command then devolved on General Harrison, who was shortly after attacked by General Proctor, and his Fort on the Miamis invested.A re-enforcement of 1300 men attempted to find their way through our lines to the Fort, in which they succeeded with loss, however, of 500 men taken prisoners.The next appeared on Lake Ontario, with 17 sail of vessels for an attack on York, in which they succeeded with the loss of General Pike, and between three and four hundred men killed, principally killed by the blowing up of our magazine before our retreat, but as if a species of fatality still pursued them, they became afraid of an attack from our Indians and troops. After destroying all the public property they could find, decamped in a few days - took bag and baggage. They then proceeded for Fort George, where from internal enemies, having gained every intelligence of our plan of defence, everything seemed now in their favor. An astonishing thick fog having spread itself over the whole river and lake, by which means they were enabled to place every vessal and boat exactly where they wished them, without our being to annoy them in the least, or even knowing where they were. When the weather cleared up we found ourselves surrounded with boats and vessels on every side. They approached us with boats divisions, each division of which was stronger than our whole force put together. Notwithstanding this fearful odds, our advanced Guards received them at the point of their bayonet, and in several instances forced them again into their boats. Not content with attacking us with their men, they now opened a most destructive fire of grape and cannister from their vessels. Though the action lasted scarecely three-quarters of an hour, out of 500 brave fellows who entered the field, scarcely 200 returned.Finding further resistance quite in vain, our General Vincent, with tears in his eyes, gave the neccessary orders for a retreat, which, in spite of six times our numbers within a few hundred yards of us, was effected without the loss of a single man.We then proceecded to the head of the lake and took up a strong position at that place - our whole force consisting of about 2000 men. They after determined attacking us with 5000 men, two divisions, the first of 3000 arrived within five miles of us, at a place called Stoney Creek, the other within a few miles of them. Having intelligence from a deserter of their intention to attack us early next morning with their whole force, General Vincent called together his Officers, when it was determined to be before hand with them, and attack their front division that night. 800 of our best troops were chosen for this attack, drove them with the bayonet from their position, got possession of three field pieces, and took their two Generals Windsor and Chandler prisoners. They immediately fell back on their rear division, and the whole were making the best of their way to their boats on the lake, when to the astonishment of everybody six vessels appeared in sight under American Colors. They planted the standard on the bank, and gave them three cheers, when suddenly the colors were shifted, and the royal standard was seen flying on the vessel, which together with a few well-directed shots put them into such a condition that they decamped with the utmost precipitation, leaving everything in our hands - 19 boats - with the whole of their tents and camp equipage. They never stopped until they reached Fort George. We followed them in a day or two as far as the Beaver Dams, about 18 miles from their Fort. They determined upon attacking us there, but from our intelligence we were again beforehand with them with 420 men.We were not within a few miles of Fort George. Our troops are every hour advancing, and we are fully determined, although their force is still greatly superior to ours, to make one gallant attempt to drive them from our shores, trusting to that Divine Providence which has hitherto so strongly upheld us. We have no fears. I shall not seal this until we know the events.Robert went up last winter with Mr. Robert Dickson to bring down for our support the North Western Indians, and is expected back every day. Some of the Indians have already arrived. George and myself with Mr. Robertson are attached to Col. DeHearn of the 104th Regiment, who commands the advanced Guards, from our knowledge of the country and roats about the place, to assist him in his movements, etc. James is attached as a Lieutentant to the Incorporative Militia, and is stationed a mile or two from this. It is with the utmsot pleasure, I say, that although one or other of us, sometimes two or three together, have been in almost every action that has taken place, yet that not one of our friends have been hurt. Mr. and Mrs. Clark, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. and Mr. Tom Dickson are all well, the last you will be happy to hear has a daughter, a few days ago, as likewise Mrs. Robert Hamilton, Mrs. C.H. and Son are at York with their friends, both very well. Mr. Robert Murray is still on the American Shore at Presque Isle. We have not heard from him since the commencement of the war, but as he has no hand in this it is to be hoped he will be allowed to remain quietly at home and mind his business.The Americans, upon taking possession of Niagara, allowed the inhabitants to remain in quiet possession of their homes and property, but since their last adverse fortune they have taken up almost every gentlement of respectability and sent them over the river as prisoners of war. You will be sorry to hear Mr. Wm. Dickson is among the number. Mr. T. Dickson had to make his escape in the night. John Robertson, you will be pleased to hear has behaved himself with great propriety, and proved himself a most gallant soldier. His wife and daughter are both well. Owing to a chance in councils at Headquarters, it is determiend that no attack shall be made upon Fort George untill the vessels shall have decided the command of the lakes. James intends writing you after the attack is made. I shall leave it, therefore, to him to give you, I hope good news.Remember me most affectionately to all my friends with you and believe me my dear Aunt,Most sincerely yours, A.

The aiuthor concludes that instead of vandalizing the historic site the golf club acts as a protector and preserver.The history of golf in Niagara began in 1877, a few practice holes were laid out on the Fort George Commons by a returning officer of the British Army. The next year on the Mississauga Common a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890's golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first international Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course has never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long, a score card states that it is a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long.

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855. Sometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a ""coloured"" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the ""Negro Burial Ground"". Unfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births and deaths listed in 1850 are: Births: Mrs. James Lewis (or Lewes) of a daughter born September 2nd 1850, named Henrietta Marian Louisa Lewis (Lewes)Deaths:  Marian Brite, 10th March 1850; Sullinen Dimbrock (Solomon Tenbrock)  19th August 1850.",

General Drummond, thanking troops and militia for their gallantry at the battle of Lundy's Lane. He offers particular admiration for the efforts of several regiments (89th Regiment, 41st Light Company, detachments of the 8th or King’s regiments, 104th regiment and the incorporated militia - 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th Lincoln and 2nd York, etc). This section is signed by Lieut. - Colonel J. Harvey, the Deputy Adjutant General, in July 1814 at the Head Quarters Falls of Niagara. The document also includes a list of officers killed, wounded and missing including Lt. mcdougal who is recorded as ""mortally"" wounded. It also lists the officers taken prisoner. This section was signed by E. Baynes, the Adjutant General.    A transcript of the document follows;               ""Head Quarters Falls of Niagara 26th July 1814 D.G. Order Lieutenant General Drummond offers his sincerest and warmest thanks to the Troops and Militia engaged Yesterday for their exemplary steadiness, gallantry, and discipline in repulsing all the efforts of a numerous and determined Enemy to carry the Position of Lundy's Lane near the Falls of Niagara. Their exertions have been crowned with complete Success by the defeat of the Enemy, and his retreat to the Position of Chippawa with the loss of 2 of his Guns and an immence(sic) number of felled and wounded and several hundred Prisoners. When all have behaved nobly, it is unnecessary to hold up particular instances of merit in Corps or Individuals. The Lieutenant General cannot however refrain from expressing in the strongest manner his admiration of the gallantry and Steadiness of the 89th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Morison, and Major Clifford who ably and Gallantly supported the Lieutenant Colonel's place after he was wounded; 41st Light Company under Captain Glen, and detachments of the 8th or King's Regiments under Captain Campbell; and Royals acting with them, also a party of Incorporated Militia by whom the brunt of the action was for a considerable time sustained and whose loss has been severe To the advance under Lieutenant Colonel Pearson consisting og the Glengarry Light Infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Battusby; a small aprty of the 104th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Drummond; the Incorporated Militia under Lieutenant Colonel Robinson; and the detachment from the 1st, 2nd,4th, and 5th Lincoln Militia and 2nd York, under Lieutenant Colonel Perry, 103rd Regiment; the Lieutenant General offers his warmest thanks. They are also due to the Troops which arrived under Colonel Scott during the action. Viz. the 1st Royal Scotts under Lieutenant Colonel Gorden; 8th Kings under Major Evinus 103rd Regiment under Colonel Scott, Flank(?) Company 104, with the Norfolk, Oxford, Kent, and Essex Rangers, and Middlesex, under Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton. The admirable steadiness and good conduct of the 19th Light Dragoons under Major Lisle and of the detachment of Royal Artillery under Captain McLaughlin and entitled to particular praise. The latter officer having been badly wounded, the Command of the Artillery devolved to Captain Mackinoche, with whose gallantry and exertions Lieutenant General Drummond was highly pleased. Sergeant Austin who directed the firing of the Congrave Rockets deserves very great credit. To the Officers of the General, and of his personal Staff, To Captain Holland Aid-de-Camp, to Major General Riall Lieutenant General Drummond feels himself greatly indebted for the assistance they afforded him. He has to lament being deprived by a wound early in the action of the services of Major General Riall who was most unfortunately made a prisoner whilst returning from the field by a party of the enemy Cavlary who had a momentary possession of the Road. Lieutenant General Drummond has also to regret the wound which has deprived the Corps of Services of Lieutenant Colonel Morrison 89th Regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Robinson of the Incorporated Militia. In the fall of Lieutenant Morrison of the 104th Regiment serving as deputy Assistant Adjutant General the Service has lost a gallant, intelligent, and meritorious young officer. The Lieutenant General and President has great pleasure in dismissing to their homes the whole of the Sedentary Militia who have so handsomely come forward on the occasion, confident that on any future emergency, their Loyalty will be again equally conspicuous. He will perform a grateful duty in representing to His Majesty's Governement the zeal, bravery and alacrity with which the Militia have co-operated with his Majesty's Troops. Signed J. Harvey, Lieut.

This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. There were many activities avaliable at the hotel, including tennis.  There was also an annual International Championship Tournament. Five courts could be played at one time.

The articles within the newspaper focus on the progress that is being made by the British army during the French-Indian War.Transcriptions of relevant articles are as follows:Copty of a Letter from James De Lancey, Fsq; Lieutenant Governor of New York, to Mr. Secretary Pitt.New York, August 5, 1759Sir,As I would not slip an opportunity of conveying agreeable news, I take this, by a merchant ship, ready to sail for Bristol, with pleasure to congratulate you on the success of his Majesty's arms, in defeating the French army, coming to the relief of Niagara, which brought on the early surrender of the fort, whereby the most important pass in all of the Indian countires is brought under his Majesty's subjection.The army defeated was made up by troops drawn from Venango, Beave River, and Presq' Isle, so that those parts must in a manner lie open to Brigadier General Stanwix; and therefore I cannot doubt of his success.I received the account yesterday afternoon by express: for the particulars I refer to the inclosed relation sent me by Lieut. Coventry, Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General at Albany, which contains the substance of the intelligence I have received. Copy of Lieut. Coventry's Letter to Lieutenant Governor De Lancey.Albany, August 2, 1759SirI have this moment received the agreeable news of Niagara's surrendering to our army on the 25th ult. Six hundred and seven prisoners are on their way from Niagara for this place. Lieut. Moncrieff brought the dispatches, and sets out tomorrow morning for Ticonderoga. If Col. Amherst be not failed, let him have the enclosed.Copy of the Account of the Defeat of the French near Niagara, and Reduction of the Fort, inclosed in Lieut. Coventry's Letter.This day Lieut. Moncrieff, Aide de Camp to the late Gen. Prideaux, arrived here from Niagara, which he left the 26th inst. in his way to Gen. Amherst. From the said gentleman we have the following particulars; viz. That, after the melancholy accident of the 20th [Brigadier General Prideaux being killed by the bursting of a cohorn] the command of the army devolving on Sir William Johnson, he continued to pursue the late general's vigorous measures, and erected his third battery within 100 yards of the flag bastion. Having intelligence from his Indians of a large party on their march from the falls, to relieve the fort, Sir William made a disposition to prevent them. The 23rd, in the evening, he ordered the light infantry, and picquets of the line, to lie near the road on our left, leading from the falls to the for. These he reinforced, in the morning of hte 24th, with the grenadiers, and part of the 46th regiment, all under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Massey. Lieutenant Colonel Farquhar, with the 44th battalion, was ordered to the tail of the trenches, to support the guard of the trenches commanded by Major Beckwith. About eight in the morning, our Indians advanced to speak to the French Indians, which the enemy declined. The action began soon after, with the scream, as usual, from the enemy; but our troops were so well diposed to receive them in front, and our Indians on their flanks, that, in less than an hour's time, the whole army was ruined. The number of slain was not ascertained, as the pursuit continued for five miles.  17 officers were made prisoners, among whom are M. D'Aubry, Chief in Command, wounded; M. De Lignery, second in command,  and wounded,; also M. Marin, Leader of the Indians; M. de Villie, Repentini, Martini, Basone, all Captains; and several others. After this defeat, which was in sight of the garrison, Sir William sent Major Harvey into the fort, with a list of the officers taken, recommending it to the Commanding Officer to surrenderm before more blood was shed, and while he had it in his power to restrain the Indians. The Commanding Officer, to be certain of such a defeat, sent an Officer of his to see the prisoners; they were shown to him; and, in short, the capitulation was finished about ten at night on the 24th, by which teh garrison surrendered with the honours of war; which Lieut. Moncrieff saw embarked the mornign he came away, to the number of 607 private men, exclusive of the Officers and their Ladies, and those taken in the action. We expect them here tomorrow on their way to New York. Whitewall, September 3. This morning Lieutenant Colonel Amherst arrived here with letters from Major Ganeral Amherst to the Right Honourable Mr. Secretary Pitt, dated at the camp of Ticonderoga the 17th July; giving an account of his having taken possession of the lines of that place on the 24th, the garrison having abandoned and set fire to the fort. The preceding night, at ten o'clock, some volunteers got into the fort, and brought the colours away with them. The troops extinguished the fire as soon as possible, and saved all they could. The letters add, that Honourable Colonel Townshend, Deputy Adjutant General, was killed on the 25th of July, but on what occasion is not mentioned. Whitewall, September 10On Sunday the 8th instant, at two of the clock in the afternoon, Captain Prescott arrived with the following letter from Major General Amherst to Mr. Secretary Pitt, dated Crown-Point, August 5, 1759.Sir,I did myself the honour of writing to you a very short letter on the 27th of July, as I would not retard Lieut. Col. Amherst from settin gout, that he might acquiaint you of his Majesty's troops being in possession of the Fort and lines of Ticonderoga; and I now send Captain Prescott with this, to inform you of the great event of the redution of Niagara; and at the same time to give you an account of my arrival here with a part of the army under my immediate command.The 27th of July, I encamped within the lines, and began to level the trenches and batteries, filled up the road I had made from Lake Chaplain to the Saw-Mill River for the carrying on the siege, encamped four battalions of Provincials near the Fort for repairing the works, sent 500 men to Fort George for provisions, etc. ordered all the French boats to be fished up, and the brig and boats I had ordered to be built for carrying gunsm, to be finished in all haste, that I may be superior to the enemy's troops on the Lake. 28th. The fire was not totally extinguished. I fowarded everything as fast as possible that I might get possession of Crown Point without loss of time. In the aftrnoong I received an account of most unlucky accident, the death of Brigadier-General Prideaux, who was walking in the trenches on the evening of the 19th; the gunner carelessly fireed a cohorn and shot him, when the approaches were within 140 yards of the covered way. I immediately ordered Brigadier-General Gage to set out for Oswego, to take on him the command of that army. 29th. Five companies of Provincials arrived this day from the provinces. Intelligence that the enemy troops, which were encamped on the eastern side of the Lake, were now moved to Crown Point: I kept small parties constantly looking from the mountains into Crown Point, their two sloops, and a schooner there: They depend on my not getting boats over, and that I shall be obliged to build some of force. 30th. It raiend hard last night, and this day, which put a great stop to getting the batteaus over the Carrying-Place.31st. I ordered the Fort by the water side to be put in good order, and to be completed, as the enemy had not quite finished it: Ordered the Fort of Ticonderoga to be repaired upon the same plan as the enemy had built it, which will save great time and expenses, as it si but a small part of the whole that is ruined; the costs the enemy has been at in building the Fort and houses are very great. The glacis and covered way quite good: The counterscarp of the glacis, masonry: The counterscarp of the dutch, masonry. Two ravelins of masonry that cover the only front to which approaches can be carried on. The Fort, a square with four bastions, built with logs on the rocks, which are covered with some masonry to level the foundation. The wood part of it is the worst finished. One bastion, and a part of two courtins, demolished, but not in the front that can be earliest attacked. The casements are good; the walls of the burnt barracks are not damaged. Eleven good ovens have helped us greatly. As the situation of the Fort is very advantageous for the protection of his Majesty's dominions, and the approaches may be rendered as difficul to the enemy, as they have been to the King's troops, and that there is no fault in it but its being small, I have thought proper to have it repaired,which I hope will meet with your approbation. 1st of August. At noon a scouting party's came in, said the enemy had abandoned Crown Point; this makes no alteration in my motions, as I am already trying all I can to get forward; but on this, I sent away Major General Graham with all expedition to command the 2nd battalion of the Royal Highland regiment, and to march them to Ofwego, that in case, from the unfortunate death of Brigadier General Prideaux, the reduction should not have taken place. Brigadier General Gage may return to the attack with the utmost vigour and dispatch, and to pursue the ulterior operations of the campaign.2nd. Very rainy weather put a stop entirely to getting boats over the Carrying Place this day.3rd. A party I had sent to Crown Point, brought in a deserter from late Forbes' in a French coat, one that I had pardoned for desertion when I was at Fort George. I thought it so necessary to make an immediate example, that I had him hanged directly. Sent two hundred rangers through the woods to Crown Point.4th. The Generale at two in the morning, Assemblee half an hour later, and the Rangers, Light Infantry, Grenandiers, and two brigades of Regulars, were soon embarked, except the Royal Highland regiment that waited for boats, which detained me some time. I however arrived at Crown Point before the evening, landed and posted all the corps, some encamped and some lay on their arms. At night, Lieut. Moncrieff, whom I had sent with Brigadier General Prideaux, arrived with a letter from Sir William Johnson, enclsoing the capitulation of Niagara, both which I have the satisfaction to sent to you.5th. I ordered Lieut. Col. Eyre to trace out the ground for a Fort, which I will set about with all possible expedition. This post secure entirely all his Majesty's dominions that are behind it, from the inroads of the enemy, and the scalping parties that have infested the whole country, and it will give great peace and quiet to the King's subjects, who will now settle in their habitations from this to New York. I shall take fast hold of it, and not neglect, at the same time, to forward every measure I can to enable me to pass Lake Chaplain, and you may be assured, Sir, I shall, to the best of my capacity, try to pursue everything for the success and honour of his Majesty's arms.I am, etc.Jeff.

Cover is black with gold trim, text and image of mourners at a graveyard. Gertrude S. Hakes died at Port Robinson Ontario August 27, 1863. She was the adopted daughter of J.S. and Maria S. Hakes.Transcription is as follows:Died. At Port Robinson, Canada West, August 27, 1863, Mrs. Gertrude S. Blake, aged 24 years, adopted daughter of J.S. and Maria S. Hakes, of this city.This notice appeared in our papers without a word of sorrow or regret for the early and sudden exit it announced.My relations to the deceased were so intimate that I could claim the privilege of being silent in my grief. She was so dear to me that it is difficult for me to trust myself to speak of her. Yet I cannot allow one to pass away who was so much the pride and joy of our school for many years without some record of her great worth, and our great loss.A thousand loving and admiring hearts must crave a tribute to her memory.But what shall we say of her whose short life was spent in preparing to live? Mrs. Blake had just entered upon the career of usefulness which is woman's destiny when summoned to another sphere. She had lived long enough, however, as a wife and mother to show that she could meet, with case and skill, the claims of every social and domestic relation; that she could reproduce, in a home of her own, the beauty, comfort and hallowed influences of the home of her childhood; that she brought to the fulfillment of these duties a devout spirit, sound judgement, great energy, presistency, and enthusaism, added to affections which prompted her to consecrate all her powers to the good of others, and that high intellectual tastes and attainments, all compatable with excellence in the domestic arts, to show rich endowments well trained and used in the family, the church and the school. As a pupil of the Seminary her memory will be most lovingly and respectfully cherished, - by her classmates as one with whom it was difficult to compete - who stimulated them to their highest efforts - who took every honor of the Insitution, and was first in every brilliant achievement of scholarship.Force of character, and the submissiveness of christian spirit were envinced and cultivated by her constant struggle with physical weakness.Regulating the languor to which she was subject, and her frequent illness, as appointed by Divine Wisdom, for her moral discipline, she waited patiently for strength; pursued, with zest, a second term, or year, studies which her health would not permit her to learn throughly the first; devoted as many years as were thus made neccessary to complete the full course of study, and exercised so much good sense in the care of her health that she grew in strength as she grew in knoweldge - the willing spirit triumphant over the weak body.While our hearts are bowed with our own grief, and a sense of the loss to society of a woman so eminently fitted in teh discharge of all the affairs of love and friendship to bless it, we are sensible that the burden of this great sorrow rests upon the husband, her infant children, and her adopted parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hakes.To the latter she had evern been a beloved daughter. She came to them a bright and joyous child. They enjoyed the unfolding of her characterin the atmosphere of domestic and christian love with which they surrounded her. They afforded her facilities for the liberal culture which her powers demanded. Hopes and aspirations for her which had been excited by her high aims and resolves had been more than satisfied by the wealth of her attainments and resources. The strength, elevation and harmony of her character, she had become the delightful companion and most valued friend. When they gave her up to new relations they were happy in witnessing the broader culture which sprung from her new duties and affections.Called upon for the final seperation their consolation is that her noblest development will come from Divine Wisdom, teaching her to solve the dark mysteries of earth in the light of heaven. Their's are not buried joys and hopes, but such as lead their sould to antipate the enjoyment of her gifts and graces in that celestial home where there shall be joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighling shall flee away.She had prepared for the presence of our Lord, and when summoned to it her faith failed not. Her Saviour, whom she had glorified on earth by dedicating herself to him in early youth, and doing the work of life as in his service, supported her in her dying hour by the blessed hope that he would glorify her in heaven. It is mysterious to us that one so amply furnished with armor for the most comprehensive life-work should be smitten just as the battle of life had commenced. Yet her life is not lost. It was not a failure. She will be cherished as the type of a christian woman. Her numerous associates, to whose sorrowful regrets I give voice, will not allow her example to die. As they weep for her they will emulate her virtues.Sarah L. Willard,Principal of Troy Female Seminary.Troy, October 1863",Troy Female Seminary.

Titled: View of Fort Niagara from Canadian side.Mary Jones was one of the founding members of the RJR pottery group along with Bill Richardson and Dr. Bruce Riggs.RJR Pottery was produced in Niagara-on-the Lake between 1950 and 1964. The pottery was produced as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any of the pieces. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr Bruce Rigg office and at a home on King Street.Fort Niagara is located on the eastern side of the Niagara River opposite Niagara-on-the-Lake. First built in 1678, the fort is now dominated by the 'French Castle' which was built in 1726. The current renovated fort is now known as Fort Niagara State Part and Museum.",RJR Pottery

Militia volunteers in the ""flank companies"" of regiments were expected to serve longer periods of active duty and were trained to fight alongside the well-trained British regulars.  The regular or ""sedentary"" militia, comprised of all able men between the ages of 16 and 60, were given rudimentary training and were expected to be available for shorter periods of time, ""called up"" to work on road repairs, sentry duty, rowing bateaux, transporting supplies, and so on.  They were also expected to fight if required but mostly within their own home areas.  Militiamen had been involved in the capture of Michilimackinac in July and the capture of Detroit in August, 1812, and were a key factor in the British victory at the Battle of Queenston Heights on October 13, fighting alongside the British regulars and First Nations allies.One of the problems with the militiamen was that many of the men were also farmers, constantly worried about their farms when they were away on active service, particularly during the planting and the harvest times.  At Fort George, many of the militiamen absented themselves without leave to travel home to do the haying or the harvest.   Officially, they were considered deserters, a very serious crime in the British Army.  However, almost all of the men returned to duty after finishing whatever they needed to do on their farms.  Few thought this a serious transgression.   The British did not take it so lightly, court-martialling and heavily fining those who had gone AWOL once they returned.For the British, they needed a body of militiamen on which they could rely to be where they were expected to be at any given time.  The rules on desertion were strictly enforced to ensure that however many militiamen were expected to be on duty were indeed present and accounted for.  They also realized that these men had to return to their farms from time to time to ensure that their families had sufficient food and that agriculture did not generally suffer as a result of their military service.  After all, the British garrisons relied on locally grown food along with the salt beef, salt pork, dried peas and barrels of flour shipped from England. To control the situation, the British required militiamen on active duty to apply for leaves of absence, which would be granted when the situation permitted.  To enforce the system, patrols of Regulars and Militia watched the roads and questioned men of military age, apprehending those suspected of being AWOL from active duty.  This would have been rather trying, as few militiamen were provided with uniforms in 1812 and would have been indistinguishable from farmers and tradesmen not on active military duty, simply going about their business.  In some cases, First Nations allies were paid a bounty for bringing in deserters from the Regular Army and militiamen who had taken their leave without permission.It was very much in a man's favour to apply for legitimate leave, something readily granted providing that there was no obvious threats looming in that theatre of war.  Those with permission were given a passport to carry, a slip of paper signed by their regimental colonel, granting them leave but ensuring that they were prepared to be immediately called back from leave in the situation required.  When the recipient of this pass was questioned while on his way home, the passport provided proof that he was legally away from his post and not a deserter.This artifact is a rare example of such a passport, signed by Lieutenant-Colonel William Claus, Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Lincoln Militia.  The date of the paper was two weeks after the Battle of Queenston Heights.  No further trouble was expected that year and the British felt safe releasing a number of militiamen from active duty on the understanding that they would be called back if required.",War of 1812Lincoln Militia

John William Jackson grew up in Toronto, the place he was working at this time, so he most likely commuted from his family home instead of staying at the barracks.

The British erected the first Lighthouse on the Great Lakes here in 1804 and constructed a small gun battery nearby for defensive purposes. When the Americans declared war on the British during the war of 1812, the British underestimated the threat and did little to strengthen their defences in Niagara (now Niagara-on-the-Lake).

Fort George National Historic Park Restoration Plans.Prints of various elevation levels for Butler's Barrack 1 and Butler's Barrack 2.After turning over Fort Niagara to the Americans in 1796 Britian decided to build a fort on the west side of the river to protect their interests in Upper Canada. In 1802 construction of Fort George was complete. During the War of 1812 the fort was captured by the Americans and damaged when the Americans burned the town of Newark and retreated in 1813.  Parts of the fort were rebuilt during and after the war. By the 1820's the fort was falling into ruin. It was abandoned in favour of Butler's Barracks and Fort Mississauga. The fort, and the area around the fort was part of the Department of National Defence. After 1867 the lands were used for periodic summer military camps to train militia for national defence, on the eve of the Great War the lands were turned into a military training camp. Begining in 1919 there was a national study taken by the Federal Government on the creation of National Historic Site preservation, but there was never anything done on any actual preservation.  In 1934, due largely to depression era government work projects, the land and fort was leased to the Niagara Parks Commission for reconstruction of Fort George. By 1940 the reconstruction of the fort was complete. During World War Two the land was once again turned into a military training camp. After the war there were occasional military camps on the grounds, but these were stopped during the Cold War with a change in direction on military training due to nuclear weapons. In 1969 the site was transferred to Parks Canada and designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/048/9895428.jpg,Plan,989.5.428,Unknown,"Pencil sketch of the floor plan at the Butler House. This house was never occupied by Col. John Butler, who died in 1796, but does have a historical connection to his family.  It was moved here from its original site near present-day Balmoral Dr. (just off Mississauga St., south of Anne St.)  It may have incorporated a part of the house which Col. Butler did occupy, which was on the same piece of land as this one.  Col. Butler's house is marked on Andrew Gray's 1810 plan of the town near the 2-mile Creek - a cairn marks this spot today.  This was outside the boundaries of the original town survey, and thus not one of the lots granted in the 1790s to loyalists.  It was certainly one of the first surviving houses constructed in Niagara, but its origins are of some dispute.  Most histories attribute the building of the house to James Butler, the brother of Col. John Butler.  Col. Butler is an integral figure to the origins of Niagara, having brought together and commanded a group of loyalist soldiers from the Mohawk valley that played a large role in the American Revolution.  The Rangers disbanded in 1784 to Fort Niagara, which had been used as their base.   Butler moved across the river with a number of families soon after that to start a farming settlement to provide food for Fort Niagara.  In 1796, after Fort Niagara was finally ceded to the Americans, the remainder of the Rangers and loyalists moved across, and many of these families and their children were granted land in the town of Niagara.  Col. Butler, and much of his family, are buried in Butler's Burying Ground, at the end of Butler St.1815-1816 is generally thought to be the building date of the house, but there is some possibility the house was built prior to the War of 1812 and survived - it may have been overlooked by those burning the town in 1813 because of its location outside the town boundaries.  Janet Carnochan's History of Niagara, states that it was called the ""James Butler House,"" and that ""reliable evidence shows that it was there on the day of the Battle of Queenston Heights.""  There are also varying theories about the house's builder - it may have also been built by Ann Clement, the widow of Thomas Butler, Col. Butler's son.  In the 1850s it was owned by another James Butler, the son of Thomas and Ann, who altered the front of the house in a Greek Revival style.In the latter half of the 20th century the house was restored and moved to its current location.  The house used to have another wing, probably added by James Butler in the 1850s, to accommodate his family, which has since been removed.",Butler House275 Simcoe Street

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants’ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success.

The site is highlighted by the 1726 stone-constructed ""French Castle."" The fort surrendered to the British in July 1759 following a siege and the wilderness battle of La Belle Famille. Throughout the American Revolution, Fort Niagara was the major British supply depot for the Loyalist provincial troops, Butler's Rangers, and Seneca allies who raided rebel supply lines. Garrisoned by American troops from 1796, Fort Niagara was an important American staging area during the War of 1812. It fought several artillery duels with Fort George across the river and was captured by British and Canadian forces in December 1813. Returned to the US in 1815, the fort remained a peaceful border post.

Lake lovely this morning.  With love (?)"".  Hotel Chautauqua/Strathcona, c. 1887Built on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement, a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants’ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",

CSL ceased its service and after a short stint with a new owner, the last voyage was in 1957. Low ticket sales and increased debt were responsible for the Cayuga's failure. In 1961 she was scraped at Hamilton. It was believed that more than 15 million people travelled on the ship during its lifetime.",SS Cayuga

Gertrude.""Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara.  The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines.  It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake.  This was one of the finest hotels in North America.  The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism.  Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927.  The building was demolished in 1930.  An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished.  In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity.  A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",Queens Royal Hotel Niagara-on-the-LakeTourism Hotels

Camp Niagara brought a steady stream of troops to Niagara.  The Camp was used as a training facility for infantry, cavalry and artillery troops who went to fight in the Boer War, World War I and World War II and the Korean War. The 1st Cavalry Brigade was initially raised in December 1883 as Cavalry School Corps, then changed to the Canadian Dragoons May 1892, changed to Royal Canadian Dragoons in May 1893, then 1st Cavalry Brigade in December 1914 during the Great War.",Camp NiagaraFort GeorgeNiagara Camp1st Cavalry BrigadeCavalry School CorpsCanadian DragoonsRoyal Canadian Dragoons

There is no message.Hotel Chautauqua/Strathcona, c. 1887Built on a 92-acre lot on the northwest end of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this hotel was built by the Niagara Assembly of the Chautauqua movement, a semi-religious social and cultural phenomenon that swept through North America.The hotel was a summer resort where guests could focus on intellectual development as well as physical education. The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants’ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",ChautauquaHotelVacationTourism

Inscription in pencil reads ""Dear Brother - Hope to see you home Saturday.  Big Day Tuesday.  The man that was going over the gorge just got as far as the middle of the tunnel and he stayed there for at least ½ an hr.  They had to get a rope & throw it out to him & then he put a weight to it & let in to the river & slide down it to the boat.""The message in this postcard may have been talking about this event:Niagara Falls, New York - June 14th 1910The Great Houdin, a tight-wire performer, entertained a holiday crowd this afternoon at an international carnival here, but hardly in the manner he intended. He was on the programme for a trip across the Niagara Gorge on a quarter inch diameter cable, holding fast by his teeth. His wire was stretched 100 feet below the Upper Steel Arch Bridge, a point where it was intended his feat would be witnessed by a crowd of 80,000 assembled on the State Reservation, as well as in Queen Victoria Park.He mounted his wire and began sliding from the New York bank toward the Canadian shore. Houdin was waving the flags of both countries as he slid along the wire. A slope was planned for the wire, but the weight of his body quickly pulled the strand, making it too slack. Houdin had to stop at a point over the centre of the river approximately 1,100 feet from the American shore and still 600 feet away from completing his journey. For a few minutes the immense audience applauded his feat, but when he did not continue toward Canada It was apparent that he was in difficulties, which he indicated by waving flags. Awe-stricken, the crowds looked on while the man, diminutive in form, struggled to retain his hold on the small pulley from which he was suspended. Houdin grabbed the cable with both his hands and then crossed his legs over the wire and hung that way for 45 minutes until he could be rescued. Houdin was not more than 200 feet north of the Upper Steel Arch Bridge that had been closed to traffic sometime before his scheduled trip however there were several hundred people on the bridge watching as events unfoldedFiremen were called and responded with several hundred feet of rope. A loop was tied in the rope around the cable with about 300 feet on one side and several hundred feet on the other. One end was thrown over the bank and the foreman slid it along on the cable by walking along on the bridge. Houdin had shifted his position repeatedly and when the rope finally neared him, he almost lost his balance as he reached for it, so eager was he to accept the succor offered. When it was seen that he had grasped the rope, a cheer went up from the anxious crowd that could be heard above the roar of the great cataract. When it reached Houdin the rope was cast off from the bank and it dropped to the lower river where the steamer Maid of the Mist observing that something was amiss picked up the lower end. The little steamer struggled with the current, but kept well under Houdin, who safely lowered himself hand over hand to reach the boat, a distance of nearly 200 feet. Another great cheer arose when Houdin was hauled safely aboard and sank to the deck completely exhausted. Houdin's real name was Oscar Williams, a steeplejack from Niagara Falls, NewYork.Reference note from http://www.niagarafrontier.com/history_story.html",Queenston HeightsBrock's MonumentCarriage

Becoming a leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure boats, the company saw a major boom in production during the 1950s. Construction time took from 2-12 weeks, depending on the boat model. In the 1960s, the plant, now owned by Trojan Boat Company, turned production to large motor yachts. Business continued to increase, but production was moved to the United States in 1978 for cost savings. The last Shepherd boat built in Town was a 54-foot yacht called the Ozark Star.

Chas""Sent to Miss Caroline Rommel of Lockport NY.The Queen's Royal Hotel was known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels in Niagara, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara.  The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines.  It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake.  This was one of the finest hotels in North America.  The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. It became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism.  Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927.  The building was demolished in 1930.  An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished.  In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity.  A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",Queen's Royal HotelHeliotype Company LtdRoyal Niagara Hotel

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servants’ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair. After the fire, guests were housed by those living in nearby cottages. The damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild.",Hotel ChautauquaHotel Strathcona

Tunnels were dug into the cement to remove the material and install 3 to 6 kilns. The cement was fired and then packed into wooden barrels for sale. This natural cement was needed during the building of the Welland Canal as motar between the  large cut stone blocks. Unreliable as a building material it was eventually replaced by Portland Cement in the early 1900's which had a more stable cement that set faster. The Cement Works closed in 1905.

There are three gothic windows on the north and south side and 2 windows in front. It closed as a church in 1918 and was sold to the Women's Institute in 1928. The Institute occupied it until 1954. It remained unoccupied and idle until it was purchased by a local resident in 1967 and then donated in 1970 to the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. It was renovated and opened in Dec 1972 as the Queenston Library and Community Centre. The building was restored at this time to it's 1928 appearance, minus the steeple.

The company consisted of stockholders and a Provincial Board of Directors; members who were well known in Toronto literary, artistic, educational and church circles.The Assembly also sold lots in the area for people interested in building cottages to stay for the summer.  In 1894 the Niagara Assembly was dissolved and the Niagara Syndicate took over, composed of some of the original directors. The Chautauqua Hotel was damaged by a fire in 1909, the damages were so significant that the owners decided not to rebuild. When the movement collapsed financially the unsold part of the Chautauqua property came into the possession of the Mississauga Beach Land Co. and it was this firm that laid out the subdivision in the Town part of the property.

The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston.

Two nearby lighthouses were erected at the same time, and managed by the foghorn operator. The foghorn closed during winter months when lake navigation ceased. The foghorn operated until 1978.

The building housed two large boilers and the heavy machinery to operate the horn.

Queen's Royal Hotel: Opening in 1869, the Royal Niagara, as it was first called, was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines. The first class hotel became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. In the foreground of the photograph is the bathhouse and the boathouses. The Boathouses were owned by John Redhead. Visitors of the hotel and locals could rent boats and enjoy some leisure time in the Niagara River. As many as 45 boats could be out at one time.

Loyalist parents, was born in Niagara in 1800.His father, David Kemp, was a native of New Jersey who arrived in Canada in 1793 and in 1796 married Rebecca Ransier. His wife’s people belonged to New York, and had suffered much at the hands of the Revolutionists. Rebecca herself owned a farm which was confiscated with other property of the family. The name of Ransier (properly speaking it is Rensselaer) can be seen on muster rolls ofButler’s Rangers, and also on the U.E. List, as that of a member of the celebratedcorps.David Kemp’s father and mother were from Scotland, they came fromAberdeen about the middle of the eighteenth century and settled in New Jersey.David (born in 1769) was the second of their three sons, and there were several girlsin the family besides David and his younger brother. While David and his brother were too young to bear arms in the Revolutionary struggle, their father and elder brother were active adherents of the loyalist side. At the Kemp’s home, friends of the cause were ever welcome, and in various ways they earned the hatred of their rebel neighbours. The youngest boy, who was a baby when General Burgoyne took command in Canada, was christened ""Burgoyne"" in honor of that officer, from whom the loyalists expected such greatachievements. When the child could just speak plainly he happened one day to bestanding in the road near his mother’s house, two men, evidently wayfarers,approached and one of them asked the little fellow his name, ""Burgoyne Kemp"" wasthe reply. The questioner turned to his companion with a laugh, ""I think"" said he ""thatwe are all right and need not inquire further,"" and then told the youngster to showthem where he lived. They proved to be British agents in search of information orrecruits, and being anxious to find a resting place among friends, they rightly took theboy’s name to be a sufficient guarantee for the loyalty of his people. But the Kemp’scallers were not all of this description; before the war was over the men of the familywere hunted like wild beasts, they lay for many days in a cave or hole of some sort inthe ground; one of them contracted rheumatism so badly during their hardships that hewas a cripple for the balance of his days. When the war ended they would gladlyhave remained in their home had they been allowed to live in peace, but after trying itfor a while they went to New York State, having lost nearly everything theypossessed. They continued in New York for a few years; but being Loyalists still, andat no pains to conceal their opinions their neighbors seem to have invoked the aid ofthe authorities, and a party was sent to apprehend the older male members of thefamily. Receiving a hint of the coming danger they went into hiding near their house,and the escort was completely deceived as to their whereabouts by the lad Burgoyne,who acted as spokesman on this occasion. Shortly afterwards the Kemps crossed overto Canada.David Kemp’s name (as well as those of his brothers) appears in the list ofsubscribers to the building fund of St. Andrew’s Church, Newark, 1794, and also asone of the earliest pew-holders. They had come to Niagara in 1793, he removed toAmherstburg early in the last century, and at about the commencement of the War of1812 was employed in the Engineer Department. He accompanied the troops toBrownstown, and when Proctor retreated from Amherstburg, was one of the last who quitted Fort Malden, as he stayed to superintend the dismantling of the fort anddestruction of stores. His family also accompanied the retreat. His eldest son,Andrew was then 13 years of age. The latter used to occasionally tell his grandsonsabout those times and one of the lads wrote down part of his grandfather’srecollections. They are giving here in the old gentleman’s own words:-""After General Hull’s demonstration against Fort Malden, which ended in hisretreat to Detroit and the surrender of that post to General Brock, I saw Brock atAmherstburg; he was a fine jolly looking, middle aged man. I also saw Tecumseh; hewas a handsome, noble looking fellow, very clean and neat about his person, andusually dressed in a white shirt, deer skin leggings and other usual Indian apparel, butsometimes in a military red-coat, for he ranked as a Major-General. I have spoken tohim. He was a Shawanee, who in common with many with many other WesternIndians had been at war with the Yankees, and came all the way to Canada to fight forthe British."" ""A battle on the lake took place about 25 or 30 miles from Amherstburg,where we heard the guns. The British ships were mostly small merchantman with agun on board, commanded by a captain of the Royal Navy as Commodore. He hadlost an arm at Trafalgar. The provincials were poor sailors compared to Britishseamen, being mostly French Canadians and some of the crews were only soldiers.The vessels were undermanned and there were not sufficient guns, and what gunsthere were not good while the American gunboats carried 32prs.""Referring to Proctor’s retreat during which (on the evening before the battle ofthe Thames the Kemps were taken prisoners, Mr. Kemp said:-We were taken prisoners a short distance above the village of Chatham whileascending the Thames. Father had been left behind at Chatham to destroy a vesselwhich was there, and only came up with our detachment a short time before we weretaken. It was very late when he reached us. He at once went ashore to reconnoiterfrom a hill nearby, from there he saw the Kentucky Rifle Militia coming across thefields on horseback. We intended to reach an old empty house on the other side of theriver and attempted to do so, but before we succeeded the bank was full of men whofired some shots at us because we did not come ashore fast enough when ordered, andthey shot a woman through the cheeks. When they got us ashore, they robbed us ofeverything they could carry away even my mother’s young baby’s clothes. Theychopped up everything else including a feather bed, and out blankets they put aroundtheir shoulders. Father was furious; he told them if there had been only half a dozenof them named Naggs, who knew us, and who had formerly lived in Detroit, had tobeg and pray of father to be quiet, fearing they would shoot him. Soon after theAmerica Regulars under General Harrison came up, and my father was placed under aregular guard when he at once complained of the treatment we had received. He wasadvised to complain to the General and so mother went and spoke to him. Harrisonwas very kind to her and said ""My good woman I will do everything I can for you.""But the Militia only said ""who cared for General Harrison? None of his business whatwe do.""""My father was taken to Petite Cote near Sandwich where he lived on parolefor a time (during the winter) until one day an officer came down and told him hisparole would be up on a certain day, and that he was to go to Detroit; when with otherprisoners he would be sent to Green bush. When he got to Detroit and had reportedhimself, he noticed that the Americans seemed very lax in the way they looked aftertheir prisoners, so he began walking about and getting farther and farther away, and atlast he slipped around a corner when he took to his heels and made his way to theback of the town, where he had plenty of friends who hid him, and helped him to get across the river again to the Canadian side. Father and I then set out on April 7th,1814, to join the British forces at Niagara. My mother went to some friends atSandwich. The first day out we had a canoe to travel in, the second day being on foot,we met a man named Johnson who was out looking for his horses, he had one horsewith him and this he allowed me to ride all day. When we reached Johnson’s house,we were obliged to stay there two days lying quiet, because we heard there of a partyof Americans who were near. After this we continued our journey on foot. On oneday our way lay through the ‘Long Bush’ where the road was just a cart track and nohouse for twenty-seven miles. The walking was dreadful, the snow newly fallen beingabout a foot deep with almost another foot of mud underneath. I got so tired that Ilagged behind continually and father would have to wait for me, finally he made mewalk ahead of him. I felt very downhearted and miserable, and father kept trying tocheer me up. At last we heard a cowbell which raised my spirits a little, and aboutdark we got into the village of Delaware, where we had plenty to eat and were madecomfortable. Soon after that we had to go through the Township of Burford where thefarmers were a very disaffected lot. They were very suspicious and inquisitive as towhere we came from, and grumbled very much when we asked for a bed. They madeus shake down in front of the fire, which the hired man put out by sticking a large logon it, and there we lay and shivered all night on the floor which was made of roughlogs with large cracks between, while there was a hole under the door large enoughfor a hog to come in at.""""When we got to the Grand River the bridge was broken down, but we couldalmost wade it. Where Hamilton now stands there was only one house at that time; asmall stone cottage near the mountain."" ""We reached Niagara safely April 20th and went to a friend’s. When wearrived General Riall was down by the river, and sent up soon after to ask if there wasa man belonging to the Engineer Department come from Sandwich, father went out tohim, and was told he was wanted over at the Fort at once. General Riall asked him ifhe had brought his little boy with him and father said ‘Yes.’ The General then askedif I was a mechanic and father told him ‘No’ I had been at school. The General said‘Well, that’s better for him, but bring him along and we’ll make him useful. I was puton regular rations of bread, meat and run, and my pay was fifteen dollars per month.We stayed here in good quarters till the end of the war. I used to sell my rum for twodollars a quart. All the men got two dills extra to work on. I have seen a hogshead knocked in the morning and all gone by dark. My work was to serve out tools andrum to the men. It was excellent rum, quite thick, it is very hard to get any rum like itnowadays. It was worth twenty-five cents a gill. Our work was done outside near theFort. There was a shanty here and father used sometimes to leave small sums ofmoney on a shelf there so as to be handy. It was always stolen when he did so, andsuspicion fell on a man of the 1st Royal Scots, so a watch was set on him. He was aGerman, there were two loose stones in the foundation of the hut so that it waspossible to get under the building. A hole was made in the floor and a watch set, andsure enough the man was caught and got 200 lashes.""""The Colonel of royal Scots in order to make his men hardy, used to makethem do sentry-go in the depth of the winter of 1814-1815 without their great coats.They had come to Canada from the West Indies.""""There was a British gun-boat destroyed a few miles from Niagara. She was atYork and her commander – a lieutenant was ordered to proceed to Niagara. On hisown responsibility he under took to give passage to some ladies who were going toBurlington and went in there to land them. The wind was then in his favour buttowards evening it changed, and he found himself beating up against it, trying to makethe mouth of the river, with two Yankee gun-boats rapidly getting the weather gaugeof him. The chase could be seen from Niagara, and the ramparts on the lakeside werelined with people watching the struggle. The Americans kept heading the Britisheroff, firing at him all the time and he replying to their shots. Finding it impossible togain the shelter of the shore batteries, the commander of the British vessel ran herashore in the mouth of a creek a few miles off and blew her up. It was then dusk andthe explosion and fire in the wreck could be plainly seen by the lookers on. TheBritish officer was court-martialled and the dismissed from the service. It was said heafterwards joined the American service.""""The village of Queenston changed very little from the time I was there in1815, up to when I visited it last a few years ago.""""There was a woman who lived in Amherstburg at the time of Proctor’s retreatwhen the Americans overran the place, who used to make plate pies out of sour greenapples to which she put no sugar, and made up the paste without a particle ofshortening in it. She sold the pies to the American soldiers at twenty-five cents each.""The family were united in Amherstburg after the close of the war. AndrewKemp was an ensign in the 1st Essex Militia in after years, and assisted in the captureof the Schooner ‘Anne’ during the trouble of 1937-8. He also formed one of theexpedition to Pelee Island, March 3rd, 1938, from whence the regulars and militia aftera smart action drove the ""Patriot Army"" (otherwise ""Brigands,"" as they are describedon the old monument at Amherstburg.) Soon after the rebellion Andrew Kempentered the Engineer Department. David Kemp died in 1842, leaving a large numberof descendants. His son Andrew removed to Kingston in 1848, and retired from theDepartment in 1869, being then Clerk of Works. He died in 1887 in his 87th year.(The notes from the reminiscences of Andrew Kemp were taken by H.G.Goodfellow and the abrupt break is thus accounted for. When Mr. Kemp found thathis grandson was taking notes he stopped suddenly and would talk no more. Thepatriotism of the family was again shown in the case of a grandson, R.W. Goodfellow,who went with the first contingent to South Africa and gave his life at Paardeberg,Feb. 18th, 1900. – J.C.)",

The Battle of Chippawa was fought on July 5th 1814, and acted as the opening engagement of the Niagara campaign of 1814. It was the longest and bloodiest military action of the War of 1812.The battle took place near the Niagara river on what is known as the fields near Samuel Street's farm. It all began when a British force (including Canadian and Native men) or near 2000 men, under the guidance of Major-General Phineas Riall, attacked an invading American army of about 3,500 men under the guidance of Major-General Jacob Brown. The fighting started early in the morning and lasted until well into the evening. When it was over, the British were forced to withdraw and the Americans won the day. Three weeks later, the invaders were turned back at the bloody battle of Lundy's Lane, fought on 25 July, 1814.The Battle of Chippawa cost the lives of nearly 200 men, and most of those men are thought to have been burried right on the battle site. It marked the first time the American regulars faced British regulars in a stand-up military action fought in the open and many historians cite Chippawa as the birthplace of the modern American army.",ChippawaBattle of ChippawaGroundsMilitaryWar of 1812

The festival was organized by Brian Doherty and Calvin G. Rand with the original mandate to stimulate interest in George Bernard Shaw and to advance the development of theatre arts in Canada. Opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973 the Festival Theatre allowed the festival to mount large scale productions; drawing National and International acclaim. In 1973 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip began a Royal Tour from June 25 to July 5, visiting Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, to participate in many events. In Niagara-on-the-Lake the Queen officially opened the Shaw Festival Theatre and visited Fort George.The Festival Theatre building was designed by architect Ronald Thom (1923-1986), two other well known works include Massey College at the University of Toronto and Trent University's riverside campus.",Shaw FestivalShaw Festival Theatre

From a strategic standpoint, it was an ideal location in times of war for preventing enemy shipping from entering the river. The British erected the first Lighthouse on the Great Lakes here in 1804 and constructed a small gun battery nearby for defensive purposes. When the Americans declared war on the British during the war of 1812, the British underestimated the threat and did little to strengthen their defences in Niagara (now Niagara-on-the-Lake). During the Fenian uprisings (1865-66), it was occupied by militia but was considered obsolete by that time and was little used until being abandoned in 1867. During World War I, the golf course (built in 1875) was closed and the Canadian Expeditionary Force used the grounds for training.",Fort Mississauga

The site is highlighted by the 1726 stone-constructed ""French Castle."" The fort surrendered to the British in July 1759 following a siege and the wilderness battle of La Belle Famille. Throughout the AMERICAN REVOLUTION, Fort Niagara was the major British supply depot for the Loyalist provincial troops, Butler's Rangers, and SENECA allies who raided rebel supply lines. Garrisoned by American troops from 1796, Fort Niagara was an important American staging area during the WAR OF 1812. It fought several artillery duels with FORT GEORGE across the river and was captured by British and Canadian forces in December 1813. Returned to the US in 1815, the fort remained a peaceful border post.

Photo taken by John Field.Formerly the location of the Queens Royal Hotel. Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara.  The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines.  It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake.  This was one of the finest hotels in North America.  The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism.  Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927.  The building was demolished in 1930.  An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished.  In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity.  A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",GazeboQueen's Royal ParkFort NiagaraNiagara River

The objective was to prepare them for a Polish army, which was quietly being assembled in France in order to free Poland from foreign rule.  In November 1917 there were over 4,000 volunteers in camp.  The camps were multinational efforts.  The French government paid volunteers five cents a day and promised an annual bonus of $150.  The American Red Cross and the YMCA provided recreation tents and the Buffalo Polish-American Citizens Organization helped clothe, feed, and transport the men to Niagara.  Canadian officers supervised the training and many town residents provided free accommodation during the winter of 1917.  By the time the last camp closed in March 1919, over 22,000 men had been trained and 21,000 of them had been sent to France to serve in the Polish Blue Army--so named because of there distinctive light-blue uniforms.

The angle is from King Street. This remarkable property—four heavily forested acres in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake---has passed intact through many hands since its origin as a crown grant to a veteran of Butler’s Rangers in 1796.The first private purchaser was Robert Pilkington, a military engineer in the intimate circle of John Graves Simcoe, who assigned Pilkington numerous commissions to erect fortifications and public buildings in Upper Canada. After only a year of ownership, Pilkington conveyed the property in 1799 to Ann Claus, in a most unusual transaction.Ann Claus was the daughter of the colonial magnate Sir William Johnson, the widow of Johnson’s chief assistant in the Indian Department, and the mother of William Claus who in 1796 succeeded John Butler as deputy Indian commissioner for the Six Nations reserve. According to the records, the purchase money was obtained by the sale of reserve land, the tribes then conveying the town property to Ann Claus in gratitude for her (deceased) husband’s ""many kindnesses"", a piece of business which could have been transacted only with the permission and guidance of her son William, the financial trustee of the Six Nations.William built the first house, but it was destroyed by the American army in 1813, when its root cellar provided winter refuge for the family of an officer at Fort George. The house was rebuilt, and William lived there until his death in 1826. He often received his Indian wards there, who camped by the banks of One-Mile-Creek, which flows through the property. The present house consists of considerable extensions upon the original 1816-17 construction, and is shielded from view by a forest which includes some extraordinarily tall and broad trees, some of them centuries old. Claus was a pioneering arborist, who planted the very tall stand of sycamores which line the property on its King Street boundary. He also introduced soft-fruit cultivation to Niagara, with an orchard of nectarines and peaches; today, only a single ancient pear tree survives from that orchard. Claus left diaries recording not only the progress of the building, but also the planting of flowers, trees, and vines in the extensive groundsIn the 1850’s the property was sold to yet another family prominent in the pioneer annals of Niagara, the Dicksons. Walter H. Dickson was the only son of Niagara’s richest man, William Dickson, whose magnificent home was burned in 1813 when Walter was seven, and William was away in a prisoner of war camp. The family fortune began with trade, but grew mightily through land speculation throughout the province, and Walter lived as a lawyer and Conservative politician until his appointment to the first Canadian Senate, in 1867. After his death in 1885, the property passed out of his family.In 1919 the property, known as the Wilderness, was bought by W.R. Austin, whose daughter Mrs. Parker became owner in 1925.  She and her daughters have faithfully preserved the historically significant estate.",

After Confederation theses lands and buildings became the nucleus of summer military training at Camp Niagara. By 1947 most of the buildings were demolished.

They are in the foreground.The future King George V was born June 3, 1865 and died January 20, 1936. He was King from 1910 to 1936. Upon the death of his eldest brother in 1892 he was named the Duke of York. Upon the death of Queen Victoria he became the Prince of Wales in 1901 when his father ascended the throne as King Edward VII. The royal tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, 16 March 1901 - 1 November 1901, was undertaken for several reasons: to assert the pivotal role of the monarch as the unifying force of the empire, to thank those countries which had contributed forces to the war in South Africa, which was still being fought, and to open the first parliament of the new Commonwealth of Australia. The tour had been postponed by the death of Queen Victoria in January, 1901 but was actively promoted by the Secretary for the Colonies, Mr Joseph Chamberlain, and the First Lord of the Treasury, Mr Arthur Balfour, despite the misgivings of the new king, Edward VII.  The Duke and Duchess visited Australia, South Africa, and Canada, landing at Quebec on 16th September and remained in Canada for a month. Accompanied by the Governor-General, the 4th Earl of Minto, and the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfred Laurier, for part of their journey, the royal couple visited Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, Niagara, St John, Halifax, and St John's. Accompanying them as well were twelve officials of the Royal Household for the Duke and seven officials for the Duchess. Among them were Prince Alexander of Teck, the Duchess's brother, as an aide-de-camp, who later became the Earl of Athlone and Governor-General of Canada 1939-1945. One of the Duke's equerries was the Hon. Derek Keppel whose mother was the daughter of Sir Alan MacNab of Hamilton, Ontario. She had married her husband, later the 7th Earl of Albemarle, at Dundurn Castle in Hamilton. (Mr Derek Keppel's sister-in-law, the Hon. Mrs George Keppel, was Edward VII's mistress, and the great-grandmother of the present Duchess of Cornwall - Camilia Parker-Bowles.)  The tour was a huge success for the monarchy and empire and for the maturing of the Duke of Cornwall into his royal role. On November 9, 1901, his father, King Edward VII, created him Prince of Wales. As George V (1910-1936) he succeeded his father as King nine years later.

Butler is an integral figure to the origins of Niagara, having brought together and commanded a group of loyalist soldiers from the Mohawk valley that played a large role in the American Revolution.  The Rangers disbanded in 1784 to Fort Niagara, which had been used as their base.   Butler moved across the river with a number of families soon after that to start a farming settlement to provide food for Fort Niagara.  In 1796, after Fort Niagara was finally ceded to the Americans, the remainder of the Rangers and loyalists moved across, and many of these families and their children were granted land in the town of Niagara.  Col. Butler, and much of his family, are buried in Butler's Burying Ground, at the end of Butler St.1815-1816 is generally thought to be the building date of the house, but there is some possibility the house was built prior to the War of 1812 and survived - it may have been overlooked by those burning the town in 1813 because of its location outside the town boundaries.  Janet Carnochan's History of Niagara, states that it was called the ""James Butler House,"" and that ""reliable evidence shows that it was there on the day of the Battle of Queenston Heights.""  There are also varying theories about the house's builder - it may have also been built by Ann Clement, the widow of Thomas Butler, Col. Butler's son.  In the 1850s it was owned by another James Butler, the son of Thomas and Ann, who altered the front of the house in a Greek Revival style.In the latter half of the 20th century the house was restored and moved to its current location.

There are two add on portions to the original house, the lean-to on the right and the small addition with the two windows. This house was never occupied by Col. John Butler, who died in 1796, but does have a historical connection to his family.  It was moved here from its original site near present-day Balmoral Dr. (just off Mississauga St., south of Anne St.)  It may have incorporated a part of the house which Col. Butler did occupy, which was on the same piece of land as this one.  Col. Butler's house is marked on Andrew Gray's 1810 plan of the town near the 2-mile Creek - a cairn marks this spot today.  This was outside the boundaries of the original town survey, and thus not one of the lots granted in the 1790s to loyalists.

""Edwin Shepherd or Ted as he was familiarly called, was the eldest son of Magistrate Edwin Shepherd and Mrs. Shepherd. He was one of those rare men who never lost the vision splendid. He had not lived in Niagara for over twenty years, but on his rare visits one could see the indomitable spirit shining through his clear eyes. In his presence, was always confidence both in his goodness and strength. None of his friends were surprised when they learned that he had thrown up everything and was entering heart and soul into enlisting a Company to take overseas with him. For many years, he had taken an interest in Military affairs and had taken the Officer's Course in Toronto He was in his military days, attached to the 23rd and then to the 98th Algonquins. When the 159th was formed, he joined that and himself recruited almost every man in the Company. He received his majority in Camp Bordon. He was offered a fine position in England but he had gone over to fight and so reverted and went to France as a Lieutenant. He writes from France:- My men are fine brave fellows; there is a great wonderful love between us and our men. They look to us as a father and we love them as they were our own sons and do everything possible for them. It is a wonderful idea, brotherly love. We have a splendid lot of Officers in our Company, such fine, gentlemanly, happy fellows. In a letter dated Sept. 10, 1917, he wrote: ""I am very lonesome tonight, I am all that is left of the Company of Officers. It is hard to part with a bunch of good fellows. I have three of my platoon yet. I feel ""like one who treads along some banquet hall deserted."" His great gift of love, and appreciation of others did not pass unacknowledged. Let me quote a paragraph from a letter to Mrs. Shepherd from a private soldier, personally unknown to her -- ""I first knew your husband when he commanded a Company in the 159th Battation at Camp Borden, where he earned the respect and regard of not only his own, but those of the entire unit. When I came to France, he was second in Command of a Company in this Battalion and as I am employed in the Battalion Orderly Room, I have a good opportunity of learning with what favour he was regarded by the Officer Commanding the Battalion.He had in his Company, many of the men of the old 159th and they were with him when he died. He led those men who knew and trusted him so well over the parapet at 5:40 in the morning of the 26th of this month (October, 1917) in an attack which has been described by the old soldiers of the unit, as the most brilliant in its history and which under the condition of mud, rain, cold, wind and murderous fire from the Enemy, was a phenomenal piece of work. It will I know, be some consolation to you and your family to know that your husband died facing the enemy, and showing that example of coolness and bravery which made the reputation of Canadians as fighting men what it is today. When a man has to die in this game, it is a mercy for him to be killed instantly as Mr. Shepherd was. To lie wounded, and to lie out in the mud of Flanders in these cold October days is to die more deaths than one. Another sentence in the same letter read:- ""A few months ago, Mr. Shepherd obtained from me a list of the old 159th men in the Battalion as he said he wished to forward it to North Bay with the idea of providing the boys with a Christmas box. It was this regard for his men which made him so popular and which will make his loss so felt. These words, unsolicited and unofficial, are a fine tribute.Letters from friends among the Officers tell the same story. They all tell of his cheerfulness and fine spirits, his coolness and bravery and his thought for the welfare of his men. Seven times before this he had led his men over the top. This time, a sniper's bullet got him when about fifty yards over. Quoting from a letter - He died as a hero leading victorious troops who gathered at the front from which they went after and they were the only outfit to carry their object that day. It is hard not to quote many more of these letters, but I will just take a sentence or two from that of his friend, a Chaplain of the Battalion. - Just before he went up the line, he attended Holy Communion. I know from conversation with him that his confidence and trust were placed in God. What a comfort at such a time, as this to be able to leave our loved ones in God's care and keeping - He is gone - What fairer death could we wish him or what nobler heritage could he leave to his sons than the record of such a life and death. A few days after word was received of his death, he was gazetted Captain.""Niagara Historical Society, No. 34, ""Whose Debtors We Are"", (1923), p. 18-20.",

Places of interest that still existing today are: Willowbank: Located centre left in the photo, visible are the distinctive large columns of the house facing towards the Niagara River. Built in the Greek Revival Style of local sandstone between 1832-1834 for Alexander Hamilton (1794-1839) the Sheriff of the Niagara District and fourth son of the powerful Upper Canadian businessman, Robert Hamilton. Owned by the Hamilton family until 1934. The architect was John Latshaw, responsible for many of the finer building designed in the Niagara area. It currently houses School of Restoration Arts, an independent educational institution which offers a three-year post-secondary diploma in building conservation skills and theory.Queenston Baptist Church/Queenston Library and Community Centre. In the centre of the photo between Queenston St. and Princess St. is the building and steeple of the Queenston Baptist Church. Built in the Gothic Revival Style between 1842-1845 with rough cut limestone. Load bearing walls 2 feet thick support the gable roof. Three gothic windows on the north and south side amd 2 windows in front. Closed as a church in 1918, sold to the Women's Institute in 1928, occupied and used by the Institute until 1954. It remained unoccupied and idle until it was purchased by a local resident in 1967, then donated in 1970 to the town of Niagara on the Lake. Renovated and opened in Dec 1972 as the Queenston Library and Community Centre. The building was restored at this time to it's 1928 appearance, minus the steeple. It is believed the wooden steeple in the front part of the building was removed when the Women's Institute made the necessary repairs and renovations when the building was purchased in 1928. Lightning and neglect made the structure beyond repair.St. Saviour Anglican Church.

Daniel Servos, a Butler's Ranger, built the family homestead (also one of the first houses in the Peninsula) in 1783 at the junction of Four Mile Creek and the Lakeshore Road. On the property (known locally as Palatine Hill) he also built a grist mill and tannery, and operated a Trading Post for the early settlers.

Mary continued to operate the farm until her death in 1905, when it was divided between two of her daughters Mary Elizabeth Servos (photograph) and Margaret Marilla Aikins. The mill and homestead property remained with Mary Elizabeth. She continued to work the farm using 3rd party farmers. In 1921 she married Samuel Snider. In the 1930's back taxes plagued the property. Efforts were made to transfer the property to the government for maintenance as a historic property. These efforts failed. In 1940 portions of the property were sold to pay the back taxes and allow Mary Elizabeth Snider to live on the property until her death in 1942 at the age of 83.

Owned for a time by a Women's Institute, the building was given to the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1970 and two years later opened as the Queenston Library and Community Centre.The Plaque that currently stands outside of it reads:By 1808 the Rev. Elkanah Holmes, a missionary from the United States, had organized the first Baptist congregation in Queenston. Following the War of 1812 the congregation declined, was reorganized in 1831 and, between 1842 and 1845, erected the rough-cut limestone structure as its church. It is an early and interesting example of the Gothic Revival style in this province. The church had closed by 1918 and in 1928 was sold to the Women's Institute, which occupied the building until 1954. In 1970 it was acquired by Dr. Djamal Afrukhteh who donated it to the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake.

Attendees listed on back but some are illegible. Some legible names include John Beverly Robinson (Lieutenant Governor at the time) and wife, General Middleton and wife, Supt. Gilkison, Mrs. Stratford, Hardy, Cleghorn, Indians.This is number 720 in the Society's 1911 Catalogue, Niagara Historical Society Publication #24. The following is from the United Empire Loyalists Association website (http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Brant-Joseph.php).  The Joseph Brant Memorial cost $16,000 and was unveiled in Victoria Square October 13 , 1886 by the Hon. John Beverly Robinson , Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. The cornerstone was laid earlier on August 11, 1886, by Chief Ka-non-kwe-yo-teh.Victoria Square in Brantford, designed by the British born architect John Turner, is laid out in the plan of the Union Jack Flag with four diagonal paths intersecting at the centre where the Joseph Brant Memorial was unveiled in 1886 at a cost of $16,000.The memorial consists of a colossal statue of Brant, nine feet in height, two groups of three life sized figures each, and two trophies flanking the sides of the upper base, and four bassi-relievi upon the lower base, which terminates in a step upon the ground line.The pedestal is of gray granite, quarried near Penryn, Cornwall, England and weighs slightly les than fifty tons. The stone is of the very finest quality and chosen with regard to a coarse grain.The right – hand group as one faces the memorial shows chiefs of the Mohawk, Tuscarora, and Oneida Nations, furnished with the scalping knife, spear, and pipe of peace. The left-hand group shows the Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga Natives, with the bow and arrows, war-club, and flintlock gun. The trophies consist of artistic arrangements of their weapons and instruments, including snowshoes and lacrosse sticks. The totems of the Six Nations, the bear, the wolf and the tortoise, are introduced in the memorial, especially at the request of the Indians themselves.On the front of the lower base is a bas-relief, showing about 15 Indians engaged in a war dance. At the back another relief shows Brant addressing the chiefs in council.Two circular reliefs at the sides are devoted to the bear, with winter Canadian scenery, pines, etc., and the owl with maple tree foliage etc.The trophy at the back of the memorial exhibits the designations of the six tribes or nations and upon the trophy in front is inscribed in bold characters the single word ""Thayendanegea"".Her Majesty’s Government recognized the importance of the work by granting 13 bronze cannon weighing about 600 pounds each, to be melted and used in the casting of several statues. Some of these guns were over a hundred years old, formerly cast at Woolwich and a number of them were in use during the Crimean War.The sculptor, Percy Wood of London, England, received his education at University College, London, England, and studied medicine for some little time. The knowledge of anatomy thus acquired has doubtless proved serviceable in the profession which he subsequently adopted.The inscription at the memorial reads:This national monument erected by the Brant Memorial Association, incorporated 41 Vic. Cap. 62 S.O. toTHAYENDANEGEACapt.

Robinson, Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario.Joseph Brant (1741-1807) was born on the banks of the Ohio River. Brant’s first appearance as a warrior was at the Battle of Lake George, where the Six Nations, under their chief, Hendrick, and Sir William Johnson in command of the colonial troops, repulsed a formidable advance of French troops composed of the old veteran regiments of France. At this engagement, which was most severe, a young Indian made himself conspicuous in the fight, so much so, that after the battle was over, his brave conduct was reported to Sir William Johnson, who sent for him.He found him to be a tall young Indian named Brant, very intelligent but uneducated, being at the time only 14 years of age. Sir William Johnson determined to have him educated, and for that purpose placed him under the instruction of Dr. Wheelock, where Brant remained until he had secured a good English education.After finishing his studies, he devoted his whole time to the welfare of his people, translating the Gospel of St. Mark and the Common Book of Prayer into the Mohawk language for their benefit and doing every thing. He could do to promote civilizing influences among them. During the American Revolutionary War, Brant and the Six Nation Indians refused all temptations and remained true and loyal to their treaties with the crown.While his role as the warrior was his most native characteristic, he was outstanding as Indian adviser and mentor of his people, Indian affairs agent, diplomat to the British and American governments on their behalf, captain in the British Army during the American Revolution War, a biblical and liturgical translator, and builder of Anglican churches. When he died, he was buried at his home in Burlington but was re-interred beside Mohawk Chapel in Brantford in 1850. Brantford and the County of Brant are both named after him.Joseph Brant encouraged Loyalist settlement. He sold or leased land to settlers and the revenue was invested to provide an income for the Six Nations.Material was adapted from The Daily Expositor, Brantford, Ontario, Wednesday October 13, 1886 and the Brant Historical Society’s Walking Tour of Victoria Square.

The Old Bank house in Niagara-on-the-Lake (first Bank of Upper Canada building) is located at the corner of King Street and Front Street, facing the Queen's Royal Park and the Niagara River. It was the First Bank of Upper Canada, built in 1817, then passed into several different transitions and owners including Lewis Shickluna (1854 to 1873) a local ship builder. Currently it is a Bed and Breakfast Inn.The first railway in Niagara was the Erie and Ontario Railroad which went from Chippewa to Queenston. In 1854 it was converted to steam and the line was extended to Niagara-on-the-Lake, terminating on the dock at the Niagara River. In 1882 the assets were turned over to the Michigan Central Railroad, closing in the 1930's.",Michigan Central RailwayOld Bank House

GlossaryStands of Arms:  A stand of arms was a musket, bayonet, bayonet scabbard, and cartridge box in which a soldier carried his ammunition.Stores:  The first floor of Blockhouse 2 at Fort George was outfitted as a Commissariat and Ordnance Store in which, among other things, stands of arms for issue to the militia were stored.Commissary:  The Commissary of the Field Train Department, part of the Army Staff, was responsible for maintaining, ordering, storing and issuing military weapons and associated equipment.  In the first year of the War of 1812 Upper Canada was unprepared to fight a war.  While the small number of British regular soldiers in the province was uniformed, armed and equipped, there was a shortage of extra uniforms, muskets and equipment for issue to the militia.  When militiamen were called out for active duty, they were expected to wear their civilian clothing.  At depots like Fort George, those militiamen who reported for active duty were issued muskets, bayonets and cartridge boxes containing sixty cartridges.  At the end of their period of active duty, the militiamen were required to return these items to stores where they would be cleaned, repaired if required, and stored ready for reissue to the next group of militiamen called out for active service.In this case, the stands of arms had been issued to a number of men of the 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia who had fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights.  When they were allowed to return to their homes, they had to return their equipment to stores at Fort George.This document is of special interest because it refers to the muskets issued as being ""French"" muskets.  The muskets when returned must have required some attention as the muskets are listed as ""repairable.""  The bayonets were still considered ""serviceable.""  The ""French"" muskets may have been French Charleville muskets, acquired in significant quantities by the Americans during and after the Revolution or possibly American made Springfield muskets, based largely on the French Charlevilles.  Both fired a .69 calibre musket ball and were collectively referred to as ""French"" to distinguish them, and their ammunition, from the British issued .75 calibre musket.  These French muskets at Fort George were taken from Fort Detroit following its surrender on August 16, 1812.  Significant numbers of these captured weapons were also given as gifts to Native allies.  It should be noted that more than 1000 additional ""French"" muskets were acquired following the defeat of the Americans at Queenston Heights.James Gordon was appointed to the British Field Train Department as an Assistant Commissary on February 5, 1808.  The Field Train Department came under the responsibility of the Master-General of Ordnance, a department that reported directly to ""Horse Guards,"" the Military Headquarters of the British Army in London, England.  The Field Train Department was redubbed the Military Stores Department, a more descriptive title, after the War of 1812.   James Gordon, responsible for the inventory of military stores at Fort George in 1812, went on half-pay on August 17, 1817, when the British severely reduced the size of the army following the Napoleonic Wars.",Fort GeorgeWar of 1812War of 1812-14Lincoln MilitiaLincoln and Welland MilitiaLincoln & Welland Militia

Issued to Mr J Blake in the amount of $40.00. Printed ticket with pencil handwriting.Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara.  The hotel was built with money received from the County after the relocation of the Courthouse to St. Catharines.  It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake.  This was one of the finest hotels in North America.  The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism.  Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927.  The building was demolished in 1930.  An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished.  In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity.

Richard C. Windeyer's military career began when he joined the 36th (Peel) Regiment in 1890. He would have attended the summer militia training camps at Niagara during this time and even took military courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston. Over the course of his service with the 36th he was promoted to Captain, a position which he held for 10 years, until he was eventually promoted to Commanding Officer. When the First World War began, he was given the command of the 74th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force which began recruiting on June 30, 1915 and trained at Niagara Camp starting on July 29th of the same year. The recruits of the 74th Battalion were supplied by four different regiments, these being the Queen's Own, 10th Royal Grenadiers, 36th Peel Regiment and the 48th Highlanders. His men took part in the Great Trek on October 18, 1915 when the officers of Military District #2 decided that the men should make a 112 km march to their winter quarters in Toronto. The march was set up as a tactical exercise based on a mock war. The troops at Niagara were to make their way through enemy- controlled territory to reinforce their allies in Toronto.When asked if the 74th was ready for the front, Windeyer said it all depended upon what front they were going to and what kind of warfare they would have to take part in. ""I could train intelligent men in three months for trench warfare"" said the Colonel. ""My men have entered into every phase of training, but we have not had sufficient field work during the winter owing to the weather. The trek [The Great Trek] from Niagara was a splendid experience for the men, they got a taste of the real thing in movement on a large scale, and the surprise attacks kept the interest alert all the time."" Windeyer never saw the theater of war, in fact he was all set to go overseas with his men-his trunk was loaded aboard the ship-when he received notice that he would not being going.

It is unclear when the Baptist congregation had its founding, but by the late-1820s, as the Baptist community increased as freedom seekers settled in Niagara, there was a desire to have a dedicated Church. But it wasn't until 1830 when the prospect of a church would become a reality. George Ball deeded lot 315 (on Mississauga Street, just south of Mary Street) in Niagara-on-the-Lake so that a Baptist Church could be built. On July 13, 1830, the trustees of the Baptists Church, Rev. John Oakley, Robert B. Groat, and James Pickard announce in the Niagara Gleaner newspaper that they were fundraising to construct a meeting house. By the end of 1830, the church was built, and it served the local white and Black Baptist community. Rev. John Oakley, a white man, was the first minister of the church, and when he left, Rev. Francis Lacey/Lacy was the first Black minister. Lacy held this position from about 1849 until at least 1855. Sometime during the congregation's history, the church became a predominantly Black congregation, but it wasn't until 1862 that the Baptist Union recognized it as a ""coloured"" church. Today, the only remnant of this church is its graveyard and plaque dedicated to the ""Negro Burial Ground"". Unfortunately, from this document it is unclear if the deceased individuals were buried in the Baptist graveyard or elsewhere, as many of the tombstones from the burial ground have disappeared. Some have apparently found their way to local front walkways and building foundations. The births listed in 1849 are: ""George Hunter (?), daughter; January 22, 1849-Mary Matilda ""Mr. Samuel Graham of a son. Born Aug 18, 1849-William Henry ""Jack (?) Washington of a daughter.

The next year on the Mississauga Commons a 9 hole course was laid out. The Niagara Golf Club was organized in 1881 based only on the Mississauga 9 hole course. In the early 1890s golf became a fashionable sport again and a 9 hole course was added on the Fort George Commons. In 1895 the first International Golf tournament was held in Niagara, 9 holes were played first on the Mississauga course, then 9 holes played on the Fort George course. The next year the Fort George course was converted to an 18 hole course. From 1895 through to 1914 an Annual Golf Tournament was held by the Niagara Golf Club on the Fort George course up until the eve of the Great War when the course was converted back into a military camp. The course never reopened. As an 18 hole course it was 4,755 yards long. A score card states that it was a bogey 82 (no mention of par). Some of the names of the holes were: Rifle Pit, Magazine, Half-Moon Battery, Fort George, Hawthorns, Oaks, Officer's Quarters, and Barracks. The longest hole was #13 at 448 yards, the shortest was #12 at 99 yards long.

One was the first jail and court house in the present area of King and Prideaux Streets.   But by 1815 the war was over.  Law and order needed to be maintained and a new jail and court house were required.It was to be built on land in the present Rye, Niagara and Charlotte Street area, donated by William Dickson, the noted local lawyer and politician.  It would be out of the range of cannon fire from Fort Niagara, for sure, but Dickson, who owned other land in the area, would have probably seen the potential of a new public building leading to development on his other lands, even though a contemporary observer wondered, in 1818, why such a magnificent building was set in a ""swamp"". The courthouse was the seat of justice in Niagara from 1816 until the late 1860's.  A number of key trials took place here, including that of reformer Robert Gourlay in 1819, as well as one for thirteen 1837 rebels who were condemned to death (most of whom were reprieved), along with those of a further assortment of debtors, horse thieves, murderers, and the like.  The jail staged many executions, floggings, placing in the pillory and, of course, it housed many convicted (and accused) criminals.In 1869 after a new courthouse was erected on Queen Street in the Town, the building was purchased by Maria Rye and renamed ""Our Western Home"", a home for young girls from England who it was believed in the view of time, has a better chance for a good life in Canada than in the orphanages or amongst the poor families in England.  Its use changed over time and it was finally demolished in the 1970's.  Its location marked by an Ontario Heritage Trust plaque.This 1815 warrant, which prescribed the construction of the building, is an important document not just for scholars of the history of early Ontario, but for those who are interested in the history, indeed legal history, of Niagara.",Court HouseCourthouseGaolRye HomeOur Western HomeKing StreetReceiver General of Upper Canada
